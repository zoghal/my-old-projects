 before you use this

(1) : A frame is a 1/75 of a second.  To calculate number of seconds, use
      x*75, where x is number of frames.

(2) : A timestring can be evaluated by taking (sec div 60)+':'+(sec mod 60)
      Here you must make (sec div 60) and (sec mod 60) into a string first
      with the STR command.

What I have done is transcribe the LZHUF algorithm into Turbo pascal.
LZH.PAS is the source code for a fairly flexible unit which can compress and
decompress any kind of datayou throw at it.  LZHTEST.PAS is a sample program
which can compress/decompress one file at a time.  
  What you see is what you get - little documentation, moderate performance
(be charitable, please), and it's free.  Enjoy.

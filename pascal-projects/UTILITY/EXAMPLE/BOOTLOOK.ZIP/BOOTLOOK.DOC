        This is a little ditty I wrote one Sunday afternoon 'cuz I was curious
    about the boot sector and the information I read that it contains.

        BOOTLOOK reads track 0, sector 1 and prints a simple (and not real well
    organized) report to the screen that tells you ...

       1.  What version of DOS was used to format the disk.
       2.  How many sectors and clusters.
       3.  How many FAT tables, directory entries and reserved sectors.
       4.  How many sectors the disk uses.
       5.  How many cylinders (tracks) are on the disk.
       6.  How many heads (sides) are used.
       7.  Total disk capacity.

        It works on floppy disks and hard drives.

        It is simple to use and totally harmless.  It might even be useful!
        The source code requires Turbo Professional 5.0 for one or two calls
        which could be done from DOS functions without too much trouble.

        Just type BOOTLOOK and press <ENTER> ...

    Enjoy,

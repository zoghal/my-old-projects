Changes to version 1.0:

        The algorithm used to calculate the initial CRC matrix has been 
optimized to run in logarithmic time instead of linear time, the practical 
upshot of which is that calculations that previously took up to a minute now 
take less than two seconds.

        Supporting C and Turbo Pascal code have been modified to support DOS 
versions below 3.0.


Changes to version 1.2:

        The previous version of the C code had a minor bug that manifested 
itself only under Microsoft C; the bug has been fixed and conditional 
compilation directives have been introduced to recognize Turbo C (which uses 
searchpath()) or Microsoft C and Quick C (which use _searchenv()) when looking 
for the program name under DOS versions below 3.0.

        The C function isvalidcrc() and the Turbo Pascal function IsValidCRC 
have been replaced with validatecrc() and ValidateCRC respectively.  The new 
functions are essentially the same as the old, but return the reason for the 
failure (no memory, file not found, etc) instead of just a success or failure 
code.  For compatibility with earlier releases, isvalidcrc() and IsValidCRC 
are still available.

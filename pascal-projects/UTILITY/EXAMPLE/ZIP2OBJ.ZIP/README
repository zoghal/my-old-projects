The following files should be present in the archive:

BOGEY.PAS          Demo program
CONWRITE.ASM       Write to Console routine using DOS call 6
CONWRITE.OBJ
GETBOGEY.EXE       Writes BOGEY.BIN to disk
GETBOGEY.PAS
VGABIOS.ASM        VGA support routines, used by program BOGEY
VGABIOS.OBJ
VGABIOS.PAS
XZIP.PAS           Explodes IMPLODED data
ZIP2OBJ.DOC        Documentation on how to use ZIP2OBJ and XZIP
ZIP2OBJ.EXE        Converts an IMPLODED file to an .OBJ file

To run the demo, follow the steps as described in the .DOC file
You need Turbo Pascal 6.0 to compile the demo; PKZIP 1.01 or later to
compress BOGEY.BIN, and last but not least, a VGA display to see the
output of the demo.  Note that the usefullness of ZIP2OBJ or XZIP does
not depend on the presence of a VGA display adapter; it's just the demo
that graphically displays the qualities of the ZIP2OBJ/XZIP combo.

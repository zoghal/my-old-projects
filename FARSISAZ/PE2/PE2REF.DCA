Introduction~


The Reference section contains detailed information about PE II,
including all of its commands.



Internal Files~


Personal Editor II (PE II) has three internal files: the .KEYDEFS
file, the .UNNAMED file, and the .DIR file.  These files are
generated inside PE II.  They provide information you can use
when editing.

o  The .KEYDEFS file holds the current key definitions.

o  The .UNNAMED file holds the last five changes you made to
   active files.  You can specify that it hold up to ten
   changes.

o  The .DIR file gives the name, byte size, date, and the time
   the DOS files were last edited for any drive or subdirectory.

You use the EDIT command to see the .KEYDEFS file and the
.UNNAMED file.  You use the DIR command to see the .DIR file.

All internal files:

o  Become active files when displayed on the screen

o  Use a part of available memory

o  Let you mark and move text to another file where it can
   be saved

o  Require a valid filename if you use the SAVE or FILE
   command

o  Are removed from memory with the QUIT command


                                2


Restoring Erased or Changed Text~


You can retrieve erased or changed text using either the UNDO
command or the .UNNAMED file.



Using the UNDO Command~


The UNDO command recovers a lost line of text.  It is initially
assigned to the Shift-F4 keys when you start PE II.  It restores
a line to the way it appeared before the cursor was moved to it,
even if it was previously blank.

UNDO restores characters that were erased or changed by:

o  Using the DELETE CHAR command (Del key)
o  Inserting or replacing characters
o  Using the ERASE END LINE command (F5 or F6)
o  Using the ERASE BEGIN LINE command

UNDO will not restore lines that were deleted with the DELETE
LINE command (Ctrl-Backspace), the DELETE MARK command (Alt-D),
or words that were erased by a series of commands assigned to a
key.

Once the cursor leaves the line that you have changed, you cannot
use the UNDO to recover the original line.  The cursor must
remain on the changed line to recover the text.



Using the .UNNAMED File~


You can also recover text by using the .UNNAMED file.  It allows
you to recover text even though the cursor has left the current
line.

The .UNNAMED file is the PE II internal file that holds the last
five changes you made to active files.  You can change this
number by using the SET BACKUP command.

If you change a line in one active file, then make single changes
in four other active files, the .UNNAMED file shows all five
changes.  If you make one more change, the first of the five
changes is removed from the .UNNAMED file.  The five changes are
separated by blank lines.

If you move too many marked lines, you may get a memory full
condition because of the space required in the .UNNAMED file to
hold the change.  To avoid this, use the SET BACKUP command to
change the number of groups of lines saved in the .UNNAMED file
to a lower number.



                                3


The following is a list of the types of changes or deletions that
appear in the .UNNAMED file:

o  Paragraphs before you used the paragraph Reflow command

o  Truncated lines that went past the right column limit of 255

o  A one-space block shift (each block shift is a single change
   to the .UNNAMED file)

o  Changed sentences up until the line had to split to fit into
   the margin settings

o  Deleted lines

o  All global and individual changes with the CHANGE command

o  Deletions using the RUBOUT command (Backspace key)

o  The same changes or deletions covered in the UNDO command

Quitting the .UNNAMED file erases its contents.  To keep its
contents, use F8 (Switch Files).



The Personal Editor II Profile~


When you start PE II, it reads a profile called PE2.PRO which
assigns the initial key definitions to the keyboard.  These
definitions are listed in the section "Default Profile
Definitions" in this document.



Converting PE Profiles to PE II Profiles~


PE profiles are compatible with PE II, with three exceptions:

o  The name PE.PRO must be renamed to PE2.PRO.  When you start PE
   II, it searches only for PE2.PRO, unless you specify another
   profile with the /p option, for example:

       pe2 /ppe.pro

o  Any instance of DOWN4, LEFT8, LEFT40, RIGHT8, RIGHT40, or UP4
   must be converted to DOWN 4, LEFT 8, LEFT 40, RIGHT 8,
   RIGHT 40, and UP 4.  This is to allow the specification of
   any numbers up to 16,300 in these commands.

o  Macros using [tab word] and [backtab word] may not work, since
   the meanings of those commands have changed.



                                4


Changing Key Definitions~


The .KEYDEFS file displays the current key definitions.  Because
it is an internal file, you can only edit (display) it when you
are in PE II.

Each time you start using PE II, the PE2.PRO file and the
.KEYDEFS file contain the same key definitions. The .KEYDEFS file
lists all the possible key definitions in the long form.  The
PE2.PRO file lists the PE II key definitions that are not already
defined internally in the abbreviated form.  Both the .KEYDEFS
and PE2.PRO file should produce the same key definitions when
starting PE II.  You can temporarily change the definition of a
key by entering on the command line the DEFINE command followed
by the keyname and the new definition, (for example, def enter =
[insert line]).

You can also assign ASCII characters to keys, for example, the
square root symbol to Alt-4.  The square root symbol is the ASCII
character for the number 251.  See the IBM BASIC manual for a
list of ASCII characters and the decimal numbers for each.

After temporarily changing a key to a new definition, you may
find that you want to save it.  Saving a new definition makes it
unnecessary to retype the DEFINE command each time you start PE
II.

You can permanently change key definitions by either saving the
.KEYDEFS file under a new name or by changing the PE2.PRO file.



Saving the .KEYDEFS File Under a New Name~


In the Learning section, you assigned the INSERT LINE command to
the Enter key using the DEFINE command. The change was temporary
because you didn't save it.  Temporary changes are erased when
you exit PE II.

You can change the same key definition by editing the .KEYDEFS
file and typing the new key definition in the file.  Since the
.KEYDEFS file is an internal file, you cannot save it. However,
you can save a copy of the changes to another file, such as PE
II's profile.  On the command line, for example, you can type
SAVE PE2.PRO.  The changes are now saved to the file and can be
activated by either exiting PE II and starting the program again,
or by using the MACRO command on the command line (for example,
MACRO PE2.PRO).

    Note:  If you choose to activate the new definitions
    by restarting PE II, you should save the .KEYDEFS file
    to the filename PE2.PRO or use the /p option along with
    the filename to which you saved the .KEYDEFS file.

    If you save .KEYDEFS as PE2.PRO, you need to reenter
    your SET commands, such as margin settings.


                                5


Changing the PE2.PRO File~


You can also save a changed key definition by editing the PE2.PRO
file and saving it. The new key definitions can be activated by
restarting PE II or using the MACRO command along with the
filename.

     Note: You should not change the filename, PE2.PRO.
     PE II looks for a file called PE2.PRO when it starts.
     If you do change the profile name, you must use the
     /p option along with the profile when restarting PE II.

You can create a completely new profile for a special use.  You
could type the special key definitions in the .KEYDEFS file,
rename the file, and then save it.  Then, when you wanted to use
the special profile, you would type the MACRO command and the new
filename on the command line or use the /p option with the new
profile when starting PE II.

If you wanted the original profile of PE II, you would then type
the MACRO command and PE2.PRO.

You can make as many profiles as you need. For example, profiles
could be designed to help you type a structured programming
language, to keep facts and figures, or to type memos or personal
letters.



Macros~


A macro is a command or group of commands that are assigned to do
a task.  Pressing a key activates the macro defined to that key.
The MACRO command activates a macro file.  As you become familiar
with how commands work, individually or together, you can combine
them to do the task you want.

The PE2.PRO file is an example of a macro file.  Each time it is
activated, whether it is at the start of a program or by the
MACRO command, each command is executed line by line in the order
it appears in the file.  This is as if you entered each command
in the PE2.PRO file one line at a time.

For more information on building macros and macro files, see the
DEFINE and MACRO commands in the "Commands" section of this
document.


                                6


Demonstration Mode~


PE II can demonstrate the actions of each of its commands or
macros automatically.  The DEMO FAST command allows the user to
see the action of each keystroke of a macro immediately, without
waiting for the entire macro or key definition to complete.

The DEMO SLOW command is similar, but inserts a short delay
between each automatic keystroke so that the operation of a macro
can better be observed.

Use the DEMO END command to tu n off demonstration mode.

By using these commands, as well as the split screen feature, you
can build demonstrations and tutorials.

You can also use the demonstration mode to debug keystroke
macros.  Suppose you have assigned a complicated key definition
to key c-f1.  The command "[demo slow] [key c-f1] [demo end]"
executes the actions of the key c-f1 slowly enough for you to
understand how it works (or fails to work).



DOS Path Support~


PE II allows DOS path names (including drive letters) to be used
in all commands requiring filenames.  A backward slash (\) is
used as the path delimiter.

PE II parses relative path names according to the current
directory and always displays full path names in the filename
field on the status line.  For example, if the current directory
is \level1\level2 and the command "e ..\new" is given, the
filename that PE II displays is "\level1\new."

You can use the CHDIR (CHANGE DIRECTORY) command to change the
current directory, as well as the default drive.



IBM TopView Support~


IBM TopView provides a multitasking and windowing environment for
software applications that run on several of the IBM Personal
Computers.

PE II can be run in the foreground of IBM TopView in normal mode.
To run PE II in the background, use the /b option when starting
PE II, which forces it to use BIOS for all screen output.

PE II requires a minimum of 112KB of memory.  You may want to

                                7

choose the Change Program Information option in TopView to
increase the maximum bytes of memory.  This gives PE II more edit
space before it must create a spill file.

PE II does not support TopView's cut and paste options.


                                8


Storage and Memory Considerations~


PE II operations make use of available memory.  You need to
consider your IBM PC memory size when you use PE II. If you load
more bytes of text into memory than your system can hold, these
extra bytes "spill" back out to the disk.  However, you can still
edit these files.

The following require memory:

o  The number of active files in memory at one time
o  The number of lines in a file
o  Bringing in new files to be edited, including internal files
o  Using marked text
o  Copying and shifting lines
o  Adding or inserting lines
o  The number of commands assigned to keys in the PE2.PRO file



Disk Spill~


When you use all the available memory, PE II uses the default
drive as a place to store more information. Once a disk spill is
created on a diskette drive, the diskette cannot be removed from
the drive until the current session of PE II has ended.  At this
time, the spill file is erased.

Five important concepts about the disk spill process are:

o  Disk spill occurs automatically when PE II requires more
   memory than is available.  No text is lost.

o  PE II creates a temporary file called PE2TMP.nnn on the
   diskette to hold additional information from active files.
   The extension .nnn is a random number.  If more than one spill
   file is created, the names will be    unique.

o  The PE2TMP.nnn file can take up to 512KB of space on your disk
   if there is adequate space on the disk.

o  PE II always requires a minimum amount of memory to operate.

o  PE II performs quickest when all files are able to fit into
   memory--retrieving from and putting information on the disk
   requires more time than doing the same within memory.


                                9


PE II automatically creates the PE2TMP.nnn file when you either
load a file that is too big for memory or when you do text
editing that fills the available memory, such as copying lines.
When this happens, the message "Spill file created" appears on
the status line.  Do not remove a spill file diskette.

The PE2TMP.nnn spill file can be up to 512KB long, if there is
enough room on your disk. If you have less than 512KB free space
on your disk, the spill file will use what is available. The
PE2TMP.nnn file is like any other file in that it takes up space
on the disk.

PE II constantly uses memory.  When it needs more memory than is
available, it writes a block of lines from an active file to the
spill file. It then uses that memory space freed up by the
transfer to operate normally.

If you check your memory with the ? MEMORY command during the
spill disk condition, you will see that memory size remains about
the same.  It needs this minimum amount of memory to operate
normally.

When the spill file is filled, the message "Spill disk is full"
appears.   You then have only the minimum amount of memory
available.  When that is used up, PE II goes into a memory full
condition where you are restricted from normal operation.  This
is explained in the next section.


                               10


When Memory Is Full~


When you have used all the available memory, PE II cannot operate
normally.  The message "Memory is full--remove files" appears on
the message line.  The "í" character (a circle with a line
through it) appears on the status line.

The message is removed by the next keystroke, but the special
character remains on the status line until memory is available.

PE II allows you to:

o  Use the EDIT command (without a new filename) to see which
   files you want to remove from memory

o  Use the QUIT or FILE command to remove active files from
   memory

o  Use the PgUp and PgDn keys to see the file that caused the
   memory to be full.  If that file was not entirely loaded into
   memory, do not use the FILE command or the text that did not
   appear on the screen will be lost.

PE II does not allow you to use operations that require
additional memory.  It gives you a message if you try to do so.
Here are the restrictions:

o  You cannot move the cursor into the text area

o  You cannot use any command that requires memory


You must remove one or more files to free memory. When memory is
available, PE II returns to normal operation.  The special
character goes away and the message "Memory full condition ended"
appears on the message line.


                               11


Commands~


PE II commands are listed alphabetically in this section.
Parameters are separated from the command and from each other by
blanks. Optional parameters are shown within angle brackets < >.
You can type commands in uppercase or lowercase, or in a mixture
of cases.

At the end of each description are related commands.

In PE II there is little distinction between functions and
commands.  Any command can be assigned to a key with the DEFINE
command.  For example, you can assign the memory command (?
MEMORY) to the Alt-F1 key combination by entering the following
on the command line:

  def a-f1 = [? memory]

You must include the square brackets when using the DEFINE
command or building a macro.

You can also type function names (such as Reflow) directly on the
command line. The square brackets [ ] are optional, but it is
recommended that you use them. If brackets are not used, any
command beginning with a C or L will be treated as a CHANGE or
LOCATE command.

You can abbreviate all commands except for the SAVE, FILE, ERASE,
RENAME, DIR, LINE, COLUMN, DOWN, UP, LEFT, RIGHT, SCROLLUP,
SCROLLDOWN, SCROLLLEFT, SCROLLRIGHT, and nine SET commands.
These must be spelled out in full, although the word "set"
itself can be abbreviated to "s." Refer to the section "Command
Abbreviations" in this Reference document for abbreviations.

There are also a set of pseudo "keys" intended only for use
within complex macro definitions.  In addition to the unshifted
state, alphabetic shift (s-), control shift (c-), and alternate
shift (a-) provided in PE II, for each of the 76 definable keys
on the keyboard, PE II allows the user shift, indicated by the
prefix u-.  For example, if two key definitions shared a long
common expression, the common part could be assigned to the "key"
u-f1 and used from within the main key definitions using [key
u-f1].  You can invoke the user shift keys directly from the
command line by typing [key u-f1].

Some of the following command syntax shows characters between
angle brackets, such as LINE <nnnn>, where nnnn is a number which
you provide.  Do not type the angle brackets when using the
command.  They are there only to show that the characters between
them are optional.  For example, the command above could be
specified by LINE, LINE 1, LINE 724, or LINE 4682.


                               12


Command Line Parameters~


When you start PE II from DOS by entering "PE2" at the DOS
prompt, you can also enter a series of options (command line
parameters) beginning with a slash (/) and separated from one
another by one or more blanks.

The letter after the slash specifies which command line option is
being set. The order of command options on the command line is
not significant.  If a command line option appears more than
once, PE II uses the last (rightmost) value.  The last command
line parameter not beginning with a slash, if any, is used as the
initial file to be read and displayed.

Command line parameters are:

/B

    The BIOS option forces PE II to use BIOS for all screen
    output.  This greatly slows PE II down, but BIOS
    compatibility may be required when running in certain
    environments.

/Pprofilename

    The profilename is processed as a file of PE II commands
    during editor initialization.  The default for this parameter
    is "/Ppe2.pro."  If PE II cannot find the named file, it uses
    an internal table as its profile.

/Rnnn

    Reserves nnn thousand bytes of random access memory for
    secondary copies of the DOS command interpreter.  Since
    PE II compresses its storage before loading a secondary
    command interpreter, it is hardly ever necessary to use this
    parameter.  The default (and minimum) value for this
    parameter is "/R2."

/Sspillfilename

    If PE II requires more storage than is available in random
    access memory, it dumps some of its internal data structures
    to the disk file named by this parameter.  The default for
    this parameter is "/Spe2tmp."  The filename extension is
    provided by PE II.

/Q

    The command line option /Q (quiet) tells PE II not to display
    its logo screen.

/W

    The command line option /W tells PE II to wait for a
    keystroke before reading the profile.  This allows you to
    change diskettes before PE II looks for the profile.


                               13


BACKTAB~

________________________________________

BACKTAB moves the cursor left to the
previous tab stop on the current line.
_______________________________________

Tab stops are initially set at every 8 columns beginning after
column 1 (that is, at 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, and so on).  You can
redefine the tab settings with the SET TABS command.

To see the tab settings, use the ?  TABS command on the command
line.

See also TAB, BACKTAB WORD, TAB WORD, SET TABS, SET HSCROLL,
? TABS, and ? HSCROLL.







BACKTAB WORD~

________________________________________

BACKTAB WORD moves the cursor backwards
through the file to the first character
of the previous word.
________________________________________

A word is defined to be a group of characters separated by
blanks.

The cursor skips back to a lower number line, if necessary.

BEGIN MARK~

________________________________________

BEGIN MARK moves the cursor to the
beginning of the current marked area, if
any.
________________________________________

The marked area may be in a file other than the current file.

For line marks, the cursor column is not changed.  For character
and block marks, the cursor moves to the far left marked
character on the first line of the marked area.

You can use the BEGIN MARK and END MARK commands as search
markers.  If you mark a character (line or block) in a file to
which you often refer, you can edit other files and then return
to the marked file by using BEGIN MARK.

See also END MARK.


                               15


BEGIN WORD~

________________________________________

BEGIN WORD moves the cursor to the first
character of the word where it is now
located.
________________________________________

If the cursor is not within a word, the cursor moves to the first
character of the word to the left of the cursor.

If there is no word to the left of the cursor, the cursor moves
to the first character of the first word on the current line.

See also END WORD, TAB WORD, and BACKTAB WORD.







BOTTOM~

________________________________________

BOTTOM moves the cursor to the last line
of the current file.

The column the cursor is in does not change.

See also TOP and LINE.







BOTTOM EDGE~

________________________________________

BOTTOM EDGE moves the cursor to the last
line of the text area of the current
window.

The column the cursor is in does not change.

The cursor moves down and the contents of the current window do
not change.

See also TOP EDGE.


                               16


CENTER IN MARGINS~

________________________________________

CENTER IN MARGINS centers each line of
the current marked area between the left
and right margins.
_______________________________________

The marked area must have been marked with a line mark or marks.

See also MARK LINE.







CENTER LINE~

________________________________________

CENTER LINE redraws the current window
so that the line containing the cursor
lies in the middle of the text area of
that window.
________________________________________

See also CENTER IN MARGINS.





                               17


CHANGE~

________________________________________

CHANGE replaces a character or string of
characters with another string.
_______________________________________

The CHANGE command searches from the current cursor position for
the first occurrence of a string, unless specified otherwise.

Format:  change/old/new/<-><*><m>

The CHANGE command consists of the keyword CHANGE (which may be
abbreviated to C), zero or more blanks, a nonblank delimiter
character, the search string, the delimiter, the replacement
string, and a closing delimiter.  The closing delimiter may
optionally be followed by the modifier characters "-", "*", and
"m".  Any combination of the modifiers may be present, but they
must appear in the order just given.

Examples:

    c!old!new!
    c'old'new'
    c xoldxnewx-*m
    c /old//*
    c/ /x/-m

To selectively replace some strings, type the CHANGE command on
the command line (without the *) and press Enter.  PE II moves to
the first occurrence of the string past the current cursor
position.

To change that present string to the new string, you must confirm
the change with the CONFIRM CHANGE command, which is initially
defined to the Shift-F5 key.

After you replace the first string, the CHANGE command and the
two strings remain on the command line.  This allows you to
search for the next string without typing the command again.

You can use Ctrl-Break to stop the search of the CHANGE command.

A nonblank character (a delimiter) must follow each part of the
CHANGE command, the present string, and the new string for the
CHANGE command to work.  The CHANGE command reads the first
nonblank character after the "c" or "change" as the separator.
It may be a letter, number, or a character such as a parenthesis,
a plus sign, or a slash.  The same character must follow each
part of the command, and the character may not be part of either
the search string or replacement string.

The options in brackets may be present in any combination, but
must appear in the order shown.


                               18

To replace a string from the current cursor position to the end
of the file (a global change), type the asterisk (*) following
the second delimiter.  When you press Enter, PE II finds all
occurrences of the present string and replaces them with the new
string.

The optional minus sign in the CHANGE command controls the
direction of the search.  If you do not type a minus sign,
searching begins at the cursor and continues to the end of the
line, and then to the bottom of the file.  If you type the minus
sign, the search begins from the cursor and continues to the
beginning of the line and then to the top of the file.

The optional modifier "m" specifies that the search is to include
only the marked area of the current file, if any.

PE II ignores whether you type the search string in uppercase,
lowercase, or mixed case, if ? SEARCHCASE is set to ANY.  For
example, if you type the string /MiXeD/, PE II finds any of these
strings:  mixed, MIXED, or mIxEd.  To see the searchcase, enter
? SEARCHCASE on the command line.

You can use the SET SEARCHCASE command to control whether or not
case is respected in the CHANGE command searches.

PE II, however, does insert the replacement string exactly as you
type it, regardless of the ? SEARCHCASE.  If the new string is
MiXeD, it will appear in text the same way.

Here are some examples of how to use the CHANGE command:

Command           What It Does

c(xyz(abc(        Changes xyz to abc individually with a forward
                  search.  Use the CONFIRM CHANGE command to
                  replace and the EXECUTE command to repeat the
                  command.

c/xyz//*          Deletes all occurrences of xyz (by changing
                  them to the empty string) from the current
                  file position to the end of the file.

c!xyz! XYZ !-*    Capitalizes and puts spaces on both sides of
                  all occurrences of xyz from the cursor
                  position to the top of the file.

c'/*'(*'*         Changes all occurrences of /* to  (*  from the
                  current position to the end of the file.

c/abc/xyz/*m      Changes all occurrences of abc to xyz only in
                  the marked part of the file from the current
                  cursor.

? SEARCHCASE.


                               19


CHDIR~

________________________________________

CHDIR changes the directory you are
using.
________________________________________

Format:  CHDIR <drive><path>

The CHDIR command changes the working directory in the same way
DOS does.  You can also include a drive letter to change the
default drive, as well as the directory or subdirectory.  CHDIR
without a drive or directory is equivalent to the ? DIR command.

You can abbreviate CHDIR to CD.

Examples:

    cd
    cd b:
    cd c:\
    chdir \new

See also DIR and ? DIR.







CLEAR MARKS~

________________________________________

CLEAR MARKS clears all marked areas in
all files, including the stack.
________________________________________

Marked areas that have been pushed onto the saved stack of marked
areas are cleared, leaving the stack empty.  No data in any file
is changed.

See also MARK BLOCK, MARK CHAR, MARK LINE, PUSH MARK, POP MARK,
and UNMARK.

CLEAR MESSAGE~

________________________________________

CLEAR MESSAGE erases any message on the
message line.
_______________________________________







COLUMN~

________________________________________

COLUMN moves the cursor to the column
specified on the current line.
________________________________________

Format:  column <nnn>

where nnn is the column number.

If you do not specify a number, the cursor moves to column one of
the current line.

MARGIN.





                               21


COMMAND TOGGLE~

________________________________________

COMMAND TOGGLE switches the cursor from
the text area to the command line or
vice versa.
________________________________________

If the cursor is on the command line, COMMAND TOGGLE moves the
cursor to its last position in the text area of the current
window.

If the cursor is in the text area, COMMAND TOGGLE moves the
cursor to its last position on the command line of the current
window.

If the cursor is moved from the text area to the command line, a
mark is left in the text area to indicate the previous cursor
position.

See also CURSOR COMMAND and CURSOR DATA.







CONFIRM CHANGE~

________________________________________

CONFIRM CHANGE replaces the search
string with the replacement string when
prompted by the CHANGE command.
________________________________________

This command works only when you search for individual
occurrences of the strings with the CHANGE command, not for
global changes.

CONFIRM CHANGE can only be used immediately following a CHANGE
command.

See also CHANGE.

COPY FROM COMMAND~

________________________________________

COPY FROM COMMAND inserts a new line
into the current file containing a copy
of the current contents of the command
line.
________________________________________

The new line is inserted after the line containing the cursor in
the text area.

See also COPY TO COMMAND.







COPY MARK~

________________________________________

COPY MARK copies a marked area at the
location of the cursor leaving the
original copy marked.
______________________________________

For marked lines, COPY MARK inserts a copy of the lines below the
line with the cursor.

For block marks, the cursor position marks the top left corner of
the inserted block.  Any text to the right of the cursor moves to
the right of the inserted text.

For character marks, COPY MARK inserts a copy of the marked area
at the cursor location.

Marked areas can be copied from other active files and windows to
the current file and window.

You cannot copy marked text onto another area of marked text.

See also MARK BLOCK, MARK CHAR, MOVE MARK, and MARK LINE.





                               23


COPY TO COMMAND~

________________________________________

COPY TO COMMAND replaces the command
line with the line containing the
cursor in the text area of the current
window.
_______________________________________

See also COPY FROM COMMAND.







CURSOR COMMAND~

________________________________________

CURSOR COMMAND moves the cursor to its
most recent position on the command
line of the current window.
_______________________________________

If the cursor is in the text area, CURSOR COMMAND moves the
cursor to the command line of the current window.  A pointer
is left in the text area to indicate the previous cursor
position.

The cursor position is maintained separately for each window,
even if the same file appears in multiple windows.

This command works exactly the opposite of the CURSOR DATA
command.

See also COMMAND TOGGLE and CURSOR DATA.





                               24


CURSOR DATA~

________________________________________

CURSOR DATA moves the cursor to its most
recent position in the text area of the
current window.
________________________________________

The cursor position is maintained separately for each window,
even if the same file appears in multiple windows.

This command works exactly the opposite of CURSOR COMMAND.

See also COMMAND TOGGLE and CURSOR COMMAND.







DEFINE~

________________________________________

DEFINE assigns a macro to a key.
________________________________________

Format:  define keyname = macro

The DEFINE command consists of the keyword DEFINE (which may be
abbreviated DEF or just D), one or more spaces, a keyname, zero
or more spaces, an equals sign, zero or more spaces, followed by
a macro.  A macro is a sequence of terms, possibly empty.  Each
term can be a PE II command enclosed in square brackets [], or a
character string enclosed in single or double quotes, or a
three-digit character code enclosed in square brackets, or a
keyname enclosed in square brackets and preceded by the word
"key."  Examples of keynames are:  ins (for Insert), s-f1 (for
Shift-F1), and c-pgup for Ctrl-PgUp.

Examples:

     def f1 = [unmark]
     d f1 = [um]
     define f1 = 'abc'
     def f1 = "'"
     def f1 = [unmark] [dir a:] 'xyz' [key f2]
     def f1 = [012] [key f2] [def f1 = [key f3]] 'asdf'

You can assign commands or literal strings, or a combination of
the two.


                               25

Commands are names from this section of the document.  The
commands must be in brackets [] and can be abbreviated to save
space.  Refer to the "Command Abbreviations" section of this
document for the abbreviations.

Literals are character strings enclosed in quotes that by
themselves do not do anything except appear either in the text or
on the command line.  When you invoke a macro, the characters in
a literal are entered as if they were typed at the current cursor
position.

You may use either single (') or double (") quotes around a
literal.  Single (double) quotes may not appear inside a
character string enclosed in single (double) quotes.  (Use a
different quote mark inside another quote mark, for example:
"'Personal Editor II'")

Once you assign a command or literal string to a key,
typing the key performs the sequence of literals and commands.

The order that you type the commands and literals is the order
in which PE II performs them.

To remove a definition assigned to a key, type the DEFINE command
and the key without a command or literal.

Example:

     d a-t =

See also MACRO, ? KEY, and EDIT .KEYDEFS.







DELETE CHAR~

________________________________________

DELETE CHAR deletes the character at the
cursor and shifts the remaining
characters to the right of the cursor
one position left.
________________________________________

If a character is within a character marked area, the boundaries
of the marked area will be updated appropriately.

See also RUBOUT.


                               26


DELETE LINE~

________________________________________

DELETE LINE deletes the current line.
________________________________________

DELETE LINE shifts the remaining text up one line after it
deletes a line.

If a line is within a marked area, the boundaries of the marked
area will be updated appropriately.

The command has no effect if used when the cursor is on the
command line.

See also INSERT LINE and DELETE MARK.







DELETE MARK~

________________________________________

DELETE MARK deletes the text in the
marked area and unmarks the file.
________________________________________

For line marks, DELETE MARK erases the marked line or group of
lines and closes the gap.

For block marks, DELETE MARK acts as if you used DELETE CHAR on
each character inside the mark.  If any text is to the right of
the marked block, it is shifted left by the same number of
columns of text that were erased.  Lines of text below deleted
marked blocks do not move up.

For character marks, lines contained within the marked area are
erased.  The marked areas on the first and last lines of the
marked area are deleted as with the ERASE END LINE and ERASE
BEGIN LINE commands.  If characters remain on the beginning and
end lines of the marked area, DELETE MARK joins the two line
fragments together.

See also UNMARK, MARK BLOCK, MARK CHAR, and MARK LINE.

DEMO END~

________________________________________

DEMO END turns off demonstration mode.
________________________________________

DEMO END forces PE II to normal mode in which screen updates are
delayed until all activity from the current keystroke or macro
has ended.

See also DEMO FAST and DEMO SLOW.







DEMO FAST~

________________________________________

DEMO FAST turns on demonstration mode
but does not force a delay between each
command executed.
________________________________________

In demonstration mode, the screen is updated after each command.
This is unlike normal mode in which screen updates are delayed
until all activity from the current keystroke or macro has ended.

DIR~

________________________________________

DIR lists all files of a current
directory or of a specified directory
in the internal file .DIR.
________________________________________

Format:  dir <drive><path><filename<.ext>>

The DIR command consists of the keyword DIR, one or more
blanks, an optional drive, an optional path, and an optional
filename with an optional extension.  The file specification may
contain wild card characters.  See the DIR command in the DOS
manual for information about wildcard characters.

Examples:

     dir
     dir a:
     dir a:\p*.*
     dir ..\direct\abc?.?

The DIR command gives a snapshot of the current files on a disk,
just as the .keydefs file gives a snapshot of the current key
definitions.

The .DIR file is an internal file that you can rename and save.

You can use the global characters ? and * in the filename and
the extension.

If you had a group of files that had similar names except for a
few characters, you could type ? for each character where the
filenames vary and receive those files.

For example, dir c:\word\appendx? lists all the files on drive C
in the subdirectory "word" that begin with "appendx" and end with
a different character.

An * in a filename or in a filename extension indicates that any
character or group of characters can occupy that position and all
the remaining positions in the filename or extension.

For example, dir *.bas lists all the files on the current
directory and subdirectory that have the extension .bas.

To see a current drive and path, enter ? DIR on the command
line.

See also CHDIR and ? DIR.

DOS~

________________________________________

DOS loads another copy of the command
interpreter into memory and allows
execution of any DOS program or command.
________________________________________

PE II squeezes all of its dynamic memory together, releases
any that remains to DOS, then invokes another copy of the command
interpreter (usually COMMAND.COM).  PE II uses the COMSPEC=
parameter of its environment to find the location of the command
interpreter.

Use the command ? MEMORY to see how much memory is available.
That amount of memory will be available to the secondary command
interpreter, although some of the memory will be used up to load
COMMAND.COM.  Therefore, the PE II ? MEMORY command and the DOS
CHKDSK commands will not give the same number for bytes of
available memory.  The secondary command interpreter can be used
to execute any DOS program or command.

To return to PE II, leave the command interpreter using the
special command EXIT.  PE II checksums all of its code and data
areas before and after the command interpreter runs to protect
itself against modification by programs run from the secondary
command interpreter.  If you change an active PE II file while in
DOS, you will need to reload the file to use the changed file
because PE II will not contain the changes when you exit to it.

Do not run programs in the secondary command interpreter that
remain resident because memory will not be given back to PE II
after returning with the EXIT command.





                               30


DOWN~

________________________________________

DOWN moves the cursor down the number of
lines specified.
________________________________________

Format: down <nnnn>

where nnnn is the number of lines down you want to move the
cursor.

If you do not specify a number, DOWN moves the cursor down one
line.

The column the cursor is in does not change.

If the cursor is at the bottom of the window but not at the
bottom of the file, the cursor remains stationary and the text in
the window shifts up nnnn lines.

If you use DOWN on the command line, the cursor moves to the
bottom line of the current window in the text area.

See also UP.







EDIT~

________________________________________

EDIT switches to an active file or loads
a file from disk.
________________________________________

Format:  edit  <<drive><path>filename> <tabs>
         edit  <<drive><path>filename> <notabs>

The EDIT command consists of the keyword EDIT (which may be
abbreviated e), one or more blanks, an optional drive, an
optional path, an optional filename, one or more blanks, and an
optional TABS or NOTABS.


                               31

Examples:

     edit
     e c:\pe2\filename
     e filename tabs
     e filename notabs
     e .keydefs
     e .unnamed
     e

If you want to look at or change a file while another file is in
the window, type the EDIT command and the name of the file on the
command line.

If the file you specify (which can contain a drive specifier
and/or a subdirectory path) is already active, the display
switches to that file.  Otherwise, it is brought in from the disk
or diskette and becomes an active file in the ring of active
files.

If the file is already active, the EDIT command uses the margins
and tab settings the file previously had.  Otherwise, the EDIT
command assigns the file the same margins and tab settings as the
current file.

If TABS is specified, tab characters in the file are expanded to
the proper number of blanks to bring the column number to the
next tab stop in the sequence 1, 9, 17, 25, 33, and so on.

If NOTABS is specified, no tab expansion occurs.

If neither TABS nor NOTABS is specified, tab expansion occurs
according to the current SET TABEXPAND setting.  To see the
current setting of TABEXPAND, enter ? TABEXPAND on the command
line.

If the filename specified is the special file .KEYDEFS, PE II
displays a file of DEFINE commands showing the current key
definitions.  If the special file .UNNAMED is specified, PE II
displays the internal file to which deleted and modified lines
are saved before they are changed.

If you specify EDIT without parameters, the next file in the ring
of active files is displayed.   You can have up to 20 active
files.

See also FILE, SAVE, SET BACKUP, SET TABEXPAND, and SET
BLANKCOMPRESS, and ? TABEXPAND.


                               32


END LINE~

________________________________________

END LINE moves the cursor one position
after the last character on the current
line.
________________________________________

The last character or characters may be blanks.

See also BEGIN LINE.







END MARK~

________________________________________

END MARK moves the cursor to the end
of the current marked area, if any.
________________________________________

The marked area may be in a file other than the current file.

For line marks, the cursor does not change its column location
but jumps vertically to the row containing the last line of the
marked area.

For block and character marks, END MARK moves the cursor to the
exact character that is at the end of the mark.


See also BEGIN MARK.





                               33


END WORD~

________________________________________

END WORD moves the cursor to the last
character of the word in which it is now
located.
________________________________________

If the cursor is not within a word, the cursor moves to the last
character of the word to the right of the cursor.

If there is no word to the right of the cursor, the cursor moves
to the last character of the last word on the current line.

See also BEGIN WORD, TAB WORD, and BACKTAB WORD.







ERASE~

________________________________________

ERASE deletes from disk the file
specified by the ERASE command.
________________________________________

Format:   erase <drive><path>filename

The ERASE command requires a filename to be specified.  The drive
and path are optional.  If no drive or path is specified, the
current ones are used.  To see the current drive and path, enter
? DIR on the command line.

Wildcard characters are not allowed in the path name.

See also ? DIR.





                               34


ERASE BEGIN LINE~

________________________________________

ERASE BEGIN LINE erases all of the
characters on the current line at or to
the left of the cursor.
________________________________________

The cursor does not move.  The remaining text moves to the
beginning of the line.

See also ERASE END LINE.







ERASE END LINE~

________________________________________

ERASE END LINE erases characters from
the cursor to the end of the current
line.
________________________________________

The cursor does not move.

See also ERASE BEGIN LINE.





                               35


ESCAPE~


_________________________________________

ESCAPE lets you type ASCII characters at
the current cursor position.
________________________________________

The control function of the key typed just after ESCAPE is
ignored.  This is useful for entering literal characters into a
file.  For example, ESCAPE followed by the Esc key will insert
the Esc character into the file at the current cursor position
instead of executing the command or macro associated with the
key.

You can also type in any of the 256 ASCII characters by holding
down the Alt key and typing the three-digit ASCII number on the
numeric keypad.  After typing in the number, release the Alt key
and the ASCII character will appear at the current cursor
position.

See also DEFINE.







EXECUTE~

________________________________________

EXECUTE carries out the command on the
command line, even if the cursor is not
currently on it.
________________________________________

The Enter key always carries out a command when the cursor is on
the command line, even if some other command has been assigned
to the Enter key, but the EXECUTE command lets you carry out a
command also from the text area.

EXECUTE is useful for repeating a CHANGE or LOCATE command
because the commands are not erased from the command line after
being carried out.

See also CHANGE and LOCATE.


                               36


FILE~

________________________________________

FILE stores the current file on disk,
then removes the file from memory.
________________________________________

Format: file <<drive><path>filename> <tabs>
        file <<drive><path>filename> <notabs>

The FILE command consists of the keyword FILE, one or more
blanks, an optional drive, an optional path, an optional
filename, one or more blanks, and an optional TABS or NOTABS
specification.

Example:

     file c:\docs\memo1
     file memo1 tabs
     file memo1 notabs

The FILE command is the same as the SAVE command, except that the
file is removed from memory after being written to disk.

If a filename is specified, the disk file will have the indicated
name.  Otherwise, the current name of the active file will be
used.

If TABS is specified, runs of blank characters in the file are
compressed to tab characters in such a way that when the file is
read with the EDIT command and the TABS option, the tabs are
turned back into the proper number of blanks.

The NOTABS option disables compression of blanks to tabs.

If neither TABS nor NOTABS is specified, compression of blanks to
tabs occurs according to the current SET BLANKCOMPRESS setting.
To see the current setting of BLANKCOMPRESS, enter ?
BLANKCOMPRESS on the command line.

See also EDIT, SAVE, SET BLANKCOMPRESS, and ? BLANKCOMPRESS.


                               37


FILL MARK~

________________________________________

FILL MARK fills a marked area with
copies of the character specified.
________________________________________

When using FILL MARK, PE II asks you to specify the character to
be used for the fill character.  PE II then copies that one
character throughout the marked area.

If you use FILL MARK and there are no marks in any active files,
an error message is displayed.

See also MARK BLOCK, MARK CHAR, and MARK LINE.







FIND BLANK LINE~

________________________________________

FIND BLANK LINE searches forward in the
file for a blank line.
________________________________________

If the cursor is on a blank line, PE II does not move the cursor.

If the current line is not blank, PE II searches for the next
line that is blank.  If a blank line is not found, you get a
message indicating that the remainder of the file contains no
blank lines.

See also REFLOW.





                               38


FIRST NONBLANK~

________________________________________

FIRST NONBLANK moves the cursor to the
first character of the current line that
is not a blank.
________________________________________

If there are no nonblank characters on the current line, FIRST
NONBLANK moves the cursor to the end of the current line.

See also INDENT.







INDENT~

________________________________________

INDENT moves the cursor to the paragraph
margin if the current line begins a
paragraph.
________________________________________

The cursor indents to the paragraph margin only if the line above
the cursor is blank or the cursor is on the first line of the
file.  Otherwise, the cursor moves to the left margin.

See also FIRST NONBLANK.





                               39


INSERT LINE~

________________________________________

INSERT LINE inserts a new line below the
current line.
________________________________________

INSERT LINE shifts any text below the current line down one line.
The cursor moves to the first column of the new line.

If a line is within a marked area, the boundaries of the marked
area will be updated appropriately.

You can insert a blank line above text that is at the top of the
file by using SPLIT when the cursor is in the first column of the
first line.

See also DELETE LINE and SPLIT.







INSERT MODE~

________________________________________

INSERT MODE forces PE II into the Insert
mode where typed characters are inserted
in front of the cursor.
________________________________________

Regardless of its previous setting, INSERT MODE puts PE II
into Insert mode, expands the cursor to a rectangle, and
displays the word "Insert" on the status line.

When in Insert mode, if a character is inserted within a
character marked area, the boundaries of the marked area will be
updated appropriately.

See also INSERT TOGGLE and REPLACE MODE.





                               40


INSERT TOGGLE~

________________________________________

INSERT TOGGLE switches the typing mode
between Insert and Replace.
________________________________________

If you are currently in Replace mode, INSERT TOGGLE switches to
Insert mode.

If you are currently in Insert mode, INSERT TOGGLE switches to
Replace mode.

PE II indicates which mode you are in by the message on the
status line and by the size of the cursor.  While in Insert
mode, the cursor is a rectangle, whereas in Replace mode, the
cursor is an underscore.

INSERT TOGGLE controls how characters are entered.  In Replace
mode, you type over characters to replace text.  In Insert mode,
characters are inserted at the cursor position and characters to
the right of the cursor are shifted right once for each inserted
character.

When in Insert mode, if a character is inserted within a
character marked area, the boundaries of the marked area will be
updated appropriately.

See also INSERT MODE and REPLACE MODE.







JOIN~

________________________________________

JOIN connects the line below the current
line to the end of the current line.
_______________________________________

The cursor may be located anywhere on the current line and does
not move after the two lines are joined.

If the combined line is longer than 255 characters, JOIN erases
any character after 255 and displays "Line(s) truncated" on the
message line.

You can recover the two original lines from the .UNNAMED internal
file.

See also SPLIT.


                               41


KEY~

________________________________________

KEY allows the direct execution of a
macro assigned to a key.
_______________________________________

Format:  key keyname

The KEY command consists of the keyword KEY followed by a blank
and a keyname.  The keyname can be any one of the 238 keyboard or
76 user shift keys.

Examples:

     [key s-a]
     [key f1]
     [key s-minus]
     [key u-m]

To assist in long key definitions, PE II allows one key to invoke
another with the KEY command.  However, PE II guards against the
possibility of an infinite loop due to keys that call themselves
directly or indirectly by restricting the number of levels of the
use of the same KEY command to five.

For more information on the different types of redefinable keys,
see the beginning of this section, "Commands," or the section
"Command Abbreviations."

See also DEFINE and MACRO.







LEFT~

_______________________________________

LEFT moves the cursor left the number of
columns specified.
_______________________________________

Format:  LEFT <nnn>

where nnn is the number of columns left you want to move the
cursor.

If you do not specify a number, LEFT moves the cursor left one
column.

See also COLUMN, RIGHT, LEFT MARGIN, RIGHT MARGIN, and PARAGRAPH
MARGIN.


                               42


LEFT EDGE~

________________________________________

LEFT EDGE moves the cursor to the far
left column of the current window.
________________________________________

The cursor remains on the current line.

Since the command line scrolls independently of the text area,
the left edge column number of the command line may not be the
left edge column number of the text area.

See also RIGHT EDGE.







LEFT MARGIN~

________________________________________

LEFT MARGIN moves the cursor to the
column identified as the left margin as
set by the SET MARGINS command.
________________________________________

The cursor remains on the current line.

To see the current setting of the margins, enter ? MARGINS on
the command line.

See also RIGHT MARGIN, PARAGRAPH MARGIN, SET MARGINS, and ?
MARGINS.





                               43


LINE~

________________________________________

LINE moves the cursor in the current
file to the line number specified.
________________________________________

Format:  LINE <nnnn>

where nnnn is the line number.

If you do not specify a number, the cursor moves to the first
line of the current file.

The column number is not changed.

See also TOP and BOTTOM.







LOCATE~

________________________________________

LOCATE finds the next (or previous)
occurrence of a string, searching from
the cursor position.
________________________________________

Format:  locate /string/<-><m>

The LOCATE command consists of the keyword LOCATE (which may be
abbreviated L), zero or more blanks, a nonblank delimiter
character, the search string, an optional closing delimiter, and,
after the closing delimiter, the optional modifier "-" and the
optional modifier "m".

If the delimiter is a forward slash (/), the LOCATE keyword can
be omitted.

Examples:

     locate "string"
     l/string/
     /string
     /string/-m


                               44

PE II searches for the string and moves the cursor to the first
place it is found, displaying a new screen if necessary.

The LOCATE command and the string remain on the command line
after the LOCATE command is executed.  This allows you to repeat
the search for the next string without typing the command again.

You can use Ctrl-Break to stop the LOCATE command.

The options in brackets may be present in any combination but
must appear only after a closing delimiter and in the order
shown.

The optional minus sign in the LOCATE command controls the
direction of the search.  If the minus sign follows the
delimiter, the search begins at the current file position and
searches toward the top of the file.  If the minus sign is not
specified, the search direction is forward, toward the bottom of
the file.

The optional modifier "m" indicates the search is only to include
the marked area of the current file, if any.

The LOCATE command, like the CHANGE command, ignores whether you
type the string in uppercase or lowercase when it searches for
the string if SEARCHCASE is set to ANY.  For example, if the
string is /MiXeD/, the LOCATE command finds any of the strings:
mixed, MIXED, or mIxEd.  To see the SEARCHCASE, enter
? SEARCHCASE on the command line.




Examples:

Command             Comments
-------             --------

/xyz                Searches forward for xyz.

/xyz/-              Searches backward for xyz.

L'/xyz'             Searches forward for /xyz.

l'/*'-              Searches backward for /*.

/xyz abc/           Searches forward for xyz abc.

l-xyz--             Searches backward for xyz.


See also CHANGE, SET SEARCHCASE, and ? SEARCHCASE.


                               45


LOWERCASE~

________________________________________

LOWERCASE changes all uppercase letters
within a marked area to lowercase.
________________________________________

LOWERCASE will not affect any text other than uppercase letters.

If you try LOWERCASE without marking an area, a message is
displayed.

See also UPPERCASE.





                               46


MACRO~

________________________________________

MACRO processes a file of PE II
commands.
________________________________________

Format:  macro <drive><path>filename

The MACRO command consists of the keyword MACRO (which may be
abbreviated m) followed by one or more blanks, an optional drive,
an optional path, and a filename.

MACRO processes the file by internally putting each line of the
file on the command line one line at a time in the order of the
file and executes them.  The macro file itself consists of any PE
II commands from this section.

You can use Ctrl-Break to stop the MACRO.

To separate the commands in a MACRO file, use brackets ([])
around each command.

Text can be entered at the current cursor position and in the
current mode by surrounding text by single quotes (') or double
quotes (") in the macro file.  If a single (double) quote is
used, none of the characters within the quotes may be a single
(double) quote.

An ASCII character can be entered by typing the three-digit ASCII
code in brackets ([nnn]) or by using the ESCAPE command,
surrounding it with quotes, to type the character as text.  You
must specify all three digits when using the ASCII code in
brackets.

Lines beginning with an * in a MACRO file are treated as
comments.  They are not processed as commands.

DEMO FAST and DEMO SLOW are used to turn on demonstration mode in
a macro file, allowing the user to see each command being
performed as they are processed.  DEMO END turns off
demonstration mode.

The PE2.PRO file is an example of a macro.  Each time you start
PE II, it searches for the PE2.PRO file on the default drive and
path unless specified by a /p option (for example, PE2
/pprofilename).  PE II reads this file to assign the keys and set
the margins.  Any of the commands in this section can be added to
this macro file to be executed each time you start PE II.  (The
DEFINE and SET commands in the profile do not have brackets.  In
fact, most commands do not need brackets, but to avoid any error
it is recommended that you use brackets for all commands.)

If PE2 finds an error in any of the commands, it will stop

                               47

processing the MACRO file, put the current line with the error on
the command line, and display an error on the message line.

See also DEFINE and DEMO.


                               48


MARK BLOCK~

________________________________________

MARK BLOCK defines one corner of a
rectangular mark in the text area.
________________________________________

To mark an entire block, you need to highlight its opposite
corners.  You can mark an area by either the top left and lower
right corners, or the top right and lower left corners.

MARK BLOCK highlights the rectangle marked by the two diagonally
opposite corners.

If there already is a marked rectangle, MARK BLOCK redraws the
rectangle to include all of the text in the rectangle defined by
the cursor position of the first mark and the current cursor
position, provided that an action was not previously taken with
the marked block.

An error message appears if an action was taken with a currently
marked block and you use the MARK BLOCK.  An error message also
appears if you use a different second mark command, such as MARK
LINE.

See also UNMARK, DELETE MARK, COPY MARK, MOVE MARK, and OVERLAY
BLOCK.







MARK CHAR~

________________________________________

MARK CHAR defines the beginning or end
of a character marked area.
________________________________________

To mark a character or the beginning or end of a sentence,
phrase, or word in the text area, you need two marked characters
to highlight the end points.

If there are no marks in any active file, MARK CHAR highlights
the character at the cursor.

When the second character mark is placed in the current file,
MARK CHAR highlights all characters between and including the two
character marks.  No position after the last character of a line
is highlighted.

Contrast this with the highlighting for line marks, which extends
to the end of the screen regardless of the line length.


                               49

Gaps appear in the marked area if a blank line is between
character tags.  This unmarked line is included in any operation
you do to the marked area.

If there were already two marked characters, MARK CHAR redraws
the marked characters to include all of the text between and
including the first mark and the current cursor position,
provided that an action was not previously taken with the marked
character.

An error message appears if an action has been taken with the
currently marked character area and you use MARK CHAR.  An error
message also appears if you use a second different mark command,
such as MARK BLOCK, instead of MARK CHAR.

See also UNMARK, DELETE MARK, COPY MARK, and MOVE MARK.







MARK LINE~

_______________________________________

MARK LINE defines the beginning or
ending line of a marked area.
_______________________________________

To mark a line or group of lines, you need to highlight the
beginning and ending lines.

If there are no marks in any active file, MARK LINE highlights
the line of the current cursor out to column 255.

If you mark a second line, MARK LINE highlights the current line
and all lines between it and the other marked line out to column
255.

If there are already two marked lines, MARK LINE redraws the
marked lines to include all of the lines between and including
the first mark and the current cursor position, provided that an
action was not previously taken with the marked lines.

An error message appears if an action was taken with currently
marked lines and you use MARK LINE.  An error message also
appears if you use a different second mark command, such as MARK
BLOCK or MARK CHAR.

See also UNMARK, DELETE MARK, COPY MARK, and MOVE MARK.


                               50


MOVE MARK~

________________________________________

MOVE MARK copies a marked area to the
line below the cursor position, deleting
the original marked area.
________________________________________

For line marks, MOVE MARK inserts the marked text below the
cursor.

For block marks, MOVE MARK uses the cursor position as the top
left corner of the area to insert.  Any text to the right of the
cursor moves to the right of the inserted text.

For character marks, MOVE MARK inserts the marked area in front
of the cursor.

Marks can be moved from other active files and windows to the
current file and window.

You cannot overlay text onto the block marked area.

See also COPY BLOCK, MARK BLOCK, MARK CHAR, and MARK LINE.







NAME~

________________________________________

NAME changes the name in memory of the
current file to the specified filename.
________________________________________

Format:  name <drive><path>filename

PE II checks to see if the name you typed is the same as another
active filename, or if the name begins with a period.  If so, you
get an error message.  If not, the new name becomes the current
filename and appears on the status line.

The file on the diskette or disk, however, is not updated until
you do a SAVE or FILE.

You also get a message if you try to save a file with an invalid
DOS name.

See also EDIT, FILE, and SAVE.


                               51


NEXT VIEW~

________________________________________

NEXT VIEW moves the cursor in a
clockwise direction into the next
window on the screen that displays the
same file as the current window.
________________________________________

Nothing happens if there is only one window on the screen.

See also NEXT WINDOW, SPLIT SCREEN, and ZOOM WINDOW.







NEXT WINDOW~

________________________________________

NEXT WINDOW moves the cursor in a
clockwise direction to the next window
on the screen.
________________________________________

The file in the new current window may be either the same
or a different file from the one in the previous current
window.

See also NEXT VIEW, SPLIT SCREEN, and ZOOM WINDOW.





                               52


OVERLAY BLOCK~

________________________________________

OVERLAY BLOCK puts a block marked area
on top of any existing text at the
cursor position in the current window.
________________________________________

OVERLAY BLOCK works only for an area that has been block marked.
An error message appears if OVERLAY BLOCK is tried with a line or
character marked area.

OVERLAY BLOCK places the marked rectangle on top of an area of
the same size, deleting any characters in that area.

The position of the cursor marks the top left corner of the block
to be overlaid.

Lines are added to a file as necessary to accommodate the block
marked area.

Marks can be overlaid from other active files and windows to the
current file and window.

You cannot overlay text onto the block marked area.

See also MARK BLOCK, COPY MARK, and MOVE MARK.







PAGE DOWN~

________________________________________

PAGE DOWN scrolls the window down to
the next page.
________________________________________

The number of lines scrolled equals the height of the data area,
minus two lines.

If there are less than the number of lines in the window below
the last line of the current screen, PAGE DOWN displays the last
page and the Bottom of file marker.

See also PAGE UP.


                               53


PAGE UP~

________________________________________

PAGE UP scrolls the window up to the
previous page.

The number of lines scrolled equals the height of the data area
minus two lines.


See also PAGE DOWN.







PARAGRAPH MARGIN~

________________________________________

PARAGRAPH MARGIN moves the cursor to
the column identified as the paragraph
margin as set by the SET MARGINS command.
________________________________________

The cursor remains on the current line.

To see the current setting of the margins, enter ? MARGINS on
the command line.

See also LEFT MARGIN, RIGHT MARGIN, SET MARGINS, and ? MARGINS.





                               54


POP MARK~

________________________________________

POP MARK unmarks the current marked area
and pops the mark most recently saved
on the stack with PUSH MARK.
________________________________________

The saved mark is once again highlighted and accessible to
operations that require marked areas.

An error message appears if you try to use POP MARK with no saved
marks in the stack.

See also CLEAR MARKS and PUSH MARK.







PRINT~

________________________________________

PRINT prints the current file on the
printer.
________________________________________

Align the paper before you use the PRINT command.  The file is
printed as it appears on the screen, including blanks at the top
and bottom of the file.

You can use Ctrl-Break to stop printing.

If the printer is turned off, out of paper, or not online, the
following message appears:

    No printer; type r or c (resume/cancel)

Check for these possible conditions and correct them.

If you get blank lines inserted in your printout, move the cursor
to the end of the line that caused the inserted line and press Erase
Right.  You may have had blank characters at the end of the line.

See also PRINT MARK.


                               55


PRINT MARK~

________________________________________

PRINT MARK prints the marked area on
the printer.
________________________________________

You can use Ctrl-Break to stop printing.

If the printer is turned off, out of paper, or not online, the
following message appears:

    No printer; type r or c (resume/cancel)

Check for these possible conditions and correct them.

Position the paper before you use the PRINT command.  The file is
printed as it appears on the screen, including blanks at the top
and bottom of the file.

An error message appears on the message line if you try to use
PRINT MARK with no marked area.

See also PRINT.







PUSH MARK~

________________________________________

PUSH MARK saves the boundaries of the
current marked area on the stack and
removes the highlighting of the marked
area.
________________________________________

You can have up to five marked areas in the stack.  An error
message appears if you try to PUSH MARK more than five marks
onto the stack.

While pushed, a mark is not accessible to PE II operations that
require marked areas, but its boundaries are adjusted by
operations that would normally adjust these marked boundaries if
they were active.

See also CLEAR MARKS and POP MARK.


                               56


QUIT~

________________________________________

QUIT removes the current file from the
ring of active files without writing it
to disk.
________________________________________

QUIT can be abbreviated as Q.

If the file was not changed and you use the QUIT command, PE II
removes the copy of the current file in memory and shows another
file in memory (if any) without using the EDIT command.

If you changed the current file or have changed its name since
the last time the file was saved, PE II displays the message:
"Do you really want to quit?  Type y or n"

If you want to start over by removing the command, type N for NO.
Typing Y for YES erases any changes you made since the last save.

When you use the QUIT command with the last active file, PE II
returns to DOS.

See also DOS and FILE.







REDRAW~

________________________________________

REDRAW redraws the screen.
________________________________________

REDRAW erases the entire screen, then completely redraws it.

This command is useful for recovering the proper screen contents
after a message from DOS rearranges the screen format, for
example, when a message is displayed on a one-drive system after
switching to a different logical drive.

See also EDIT.


                               57


REFLOW~

________________________________________

REFLOW reformats text to the set
margins within a line marked area.
________________________________________

REFLOW reformats line marked areas only.  An error message
appears if REFLOW is tried with a block or character marked area.

REFLOW uses the left margin and right margin for its
reformatting.  For the first line of the reformatted area only,
REFLOW uses the current paragraph margin setting rather than the
left margin setting for its left boundary.  To see the current
left, right, and paragraph margin settings, enter ? MARGINS on
the command line.


REFLOW fills lines with words where possible without splitting
them at the end of the line.  It places one blank between strings
and two blanks after a string ending in a period, comma,
exclamation point, or question mark.  If a word were to extend
beyond the right margin setting, REFLOW moves the entire word
down to the next line after it inserts a new line.

If a single word is too long to fit between the left and right
margins, REFLOW splits it at the right margin.

Any line marked area is adjusted appropriately after formatting
the text.

REFLOW does not right-justify a paragraph.

See also SET MARGINS and ? MARGINS.





                               58


RENAME~

________________________________________

RENAME changes the name of a file on
disk to the one specified.
________________________________________

Format:  rename <drive><path>f1 f2

where f1 is the specified file to be renamed to f2.

The RENAME command requires two filenames.  The drive and path
are optional.  If no drive or path is specified, the current ones
are used.  To see the current drive and path, enter ? DIR on the
command line.

The RENAME command is different from the NAME command in that
RENAME changes the name of a file that has already been stored on
disk and NAME changes only the name in PE II's internal memory
that will be used to save a file to disk if or when it is saved
to disk.

See also ? DIR.







REPLACE MODE~

________________________________________

REPLACE MODE forces PE II into Replace
mode where typed characters are replaced
at the cursor.
________________________________________

Regardless of its previous setting, REPLACE MODE puts PE II into
Replace mode, changes the cursor to a blinking underscore, and
puts the word "Replace" on the status line.

See also INSERT TOGGLE and INSERT MODE.


                               59


RIGHT~

________________________________________

RIGHT moves the cursor right the
number of columns specified.
________________________________________

Format:  right <nnn>

where nnn is the number of columns right you want to move the
cursor.

If you do not specify a number, the cursor moves right one
column.

See also COLUMN LEFT, LEFT, LEFT MARGIN, RIGHT MARGIN, and
PARAGRAPH MARGIN.







RIGHT EDGE~

________________________________________

RIGHT EDGE moves the cursor to the far
right column of the current window.
________________________________________

The cursor remains on the current line.

Since the command line scrolls independent of the text
area, the right edge column number of the command line may
not be the right edge column number of the text area.

See also LEFT EDGE.





                               60


RIGHT MARGIN~

________________________________________

RIGHT MARGIN moves the cursor to the
column identified as the right margin,
as set by the SET MARGINS command.
________________________________________

The cursor remains on the current line.

To see the current setting of the margins, enter ? MARGINS on the
command line.

See also LEFT MARGIN, PARAGRAPH MARGIN, SET MARGINS, and ?
MARGINS.







RUBOUT~

________________________________________

RUBOUT deletes the character to the left
of the cursor and shifts the remaining
characters at and to the right of the
cursor one position left.
________________________________________

RUBOUT is equivalent to LEFT followed by DELETE CHAR.

If a character is within a character marked area, the boundaries
of the marked area are updated appropriately.

See also DELETE CHAR.





                               61


SAVE~

________________________________________

SAVE writes a copy of the current file
to the disk.
________________________________________

Format:  save <<drive><path>filename> <tabs>
         save <<drive><path>filename> <notabs>

The SAVE command consists of the keyword SAVE, one or more
blanks, an optional drive, an optional path, an optional
filename, one or more blanks, and an optional TABS or NOTABS.

Examples:

     save
     save c:\pe2\filename
     save filename tabs
     save filename notabs

The SAVE command is the same as the FILE command, except that the
file remains active after being written to disk.

If a filename is specified, the disk file will have the indicated
name.  Otherwise, the current name of the active file is used.

If TABS is specified, runs of blank characters in the file are
compressed to tab characters in such a way that when the file is
read with the EDIT command and the TABS option, the tabs are
turned back into the proper number of blanks.

The NOTABS option disables compression of blanks to tabs.

If neither TABS nor NOTABS is specified, compression of blanks to
tabs occurs according to the current SET BLANKCOMPRESS setting.
To see the current setting of BLANKCOMPRESS, enter ?
BLANKCOMPRESS on the command line.

See also EDIT, FILE, NAME, SET BLANKCOMPRESS, and ?
BLANKCOMPRESS.

SCROLLDOWN~

________________________________________

SCROLLDOWN moves the current file
position down the number of lines
specified.
________________________________________


Format:  scrolldown <nnnn>

If nnnn is not specified, SCROLLDOWN moves the current file
position down one line.

The cursor is forced off the command line by SCROLLDOWN.

The data in the window is scrolled so that the cursor remains in
the same screen position, except when the last window of the file
is being displayed.

See also SCROLLLEFT, SCROLLRIGHT, and SCROLLUP.







SCROLLLEFT~

________________________________________

SCROLLLEFT moves the current file
position left the number of columns
specified.
________________________________________

Format:  scrollleft <nnn>

If nnn is not specified, SCROLLLEFT moves the current file
position LEFT one column.

The data in the window is scrolled so that the cursor remains in
the same screen position, except when the first column of the
file is being displayed.

See also SCROLLDOWN, SCROLLRIGHT, and SCROLLUP.


                               63


SCROLLRIGHT~

________________________________________

SCROLLRIGHT moves the current file
position right the number of columns
specified.
________________________________________

Format:  scrollright <nnn>

If nnn is not specified, SCROLLUP moves the current file position
right one column.

The data in the window is scrolled so that the cursor remains in
the same screen position, except when the last column (255) of
the file is being displayed.

See also SCROLLDOWN, SCROLLLEFT, and SCROLLUP.







SCROLLUP~

________________________________________

SCROLLUP moves the current file
position up the number of lines
specified.
________________________________________

Format:  scrollup <nnnn>

If nnnn is not specified, SCROLLUP moves the current file
position up one line.

The cursor is forced off the command line by SCROLLUP.

The data in the window is scrolled so that the cursor remains in
the same screen position, except when the first line of the file
is being displayed.

See also SCROLLDOWN, SCROLLLEFT, and SCROLLRIGHT.


                               64


SET ABBREV~

________________________________________

SET ABBREV controls whether the long or
short form of commands are produced when
displaying a key definition with the
? KEY or EDIT .KEYDEFS command.
________________________________________

Format:  set abbrev on
         set abbrev off

If SET ABBREV ON is in effect, short command names are used in
all possible cases.  Also, the blanks separating each term in a
key definition are omitted.

If SET ABBREV OFF is in effect (the default), the entire command
is used, and commands are separated by blanks.

Both long and short command names are always recognized in DEFINE
commands, regardless of the setting of SET ABBREV.

See also ? ABBREV, EDIT, DEFINE, KEY, and ? KEY.







SET BACKUP~

________________________________________

SET BACKUP sets the number of groups of
lines saved in the .UNNAMED file.
________________________________________

Format: Set backup nn

where nn stands for a number from 0 to 10.  The default value of
nn is 5.

SET BACKUP 0 disables the saving of changed or deleted lines in
the .UNNAMED file.


See also ? BACKUP and EDIT .UNNAMED.


                               65


SET BLANKCOMPRESS~

________________________________________

SET BLANKCOMPRESS controls whether or
not runs of blanks are converted to
tab characters by default in the SAVE
and FILE commands.
________________________________________

Format:  set blankcompress on
         set blankcompress off

The default value of SET BLANKCOMPRESS is ON.  Regardless of the
value of SET BLANKCOMPRESS, blank compression can always be
controlled explicitly in the SAVE and FILE commands using the
TABS or NOTABS options.

See also ? BLANKCOMPRESS, EDIT, FILE, SAVE, SET TABEXPAND, and ?
TABEXPAND.





                               66


SET DISPLAY~

________________________________________

The SET DISPLAY command controls which
display and character font is used by
PE II.
________________________________________

Format:    set display mono
           set display color 40
           set display color 80
           set display b/w 40
           set display b/w 80

               (or)

           set display small font
           set display large font

Each display has a set of attribute bytes for the various fields
of the screen associated with it.  The default display and mode
is the one that was active when PE II was loaded.

If you have two displays connected to your system, PE II switches
the current file from (to) the monochrome display to (from) a
display attached to the color/graphics adapter.

Only one display can be active at one time.  The active display
contains the blinking cursor.

SET DISPLAY does not allow you to change displays if you do not
have the correct adapter installed on your IBM Personal Computer.

The SET DISPLAY SMALL FONT and SET DISPLAY LARGE FONT commands
are only available with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter.  These
commands control which of the two built-in fonts are used with
that adapter.

In the EGA's enhanced color mode, the large font allows 25 lines
to be displayed.  The small font allows for 43 lines to be
displayed.  In the EGA's normal color mode, the large font allows
for 14 lines to be displayed.  The small font allows for 25 lines
to be displayed.

The way PE II shows marked areas, the command line, and so on,
depends on which display the file is active.

See also EDIT.


                               67


SET HSCROLL~

________________________________________

SET HSCROLL controls how PE II scrolls
the window when the cursor tries to
leave the window to the left or to the
right.
________________________________________

Format:  set hscroll on
         set hscroll off

If HSCROLL is OFF (the default), PE II shifts the data in the
current window by half its width so that the cursor is located in
the middle of the window.

If HSCROLL is ON, PE II scrolls the window horizontally by one
column so that the cursor remains at the edge of the window.
Performance may be slower on some displays.

See also ? HSCROLL.





                               68


SET MARGINS~

________________________________________

SET MARGINS controls the boundaries used
by PE II when you enter or reflow text.
________________________________________

Format:  set margins n n <n>

The three numbers in the command are the left margin number, the
right margin, and the optional paragraph margin.  If you do not
specify a paragraph margin, SET MARGINS uses the same value as
the left margin.

The right margin must be larger than both the left margin and the
paragraph margin.  The paragraph margin can be less than the left
margin.

PE II starts with a left margin of 1, a right margin of 79, and
a paragraph margin of 1.  To change the margins, type the SET
MARGINS command and the margin numbers on the command line and
press Enter.

Example:  set margins 5 65 10

To see the current margin setting, enter ? MARGINS on the
command line.

When you use the EDIT command to create a new file or get an old
one, the margin settings for that file will be the margin
settings for whatever file was in that window when you typed the
EDIT command.

You cannot save the margin settings of a file.  They have to be
reset each time you start PE II.

PE II uses the margins for word wrapping and formatting text.  If
you are typing text and there is a character past the right
margin as part of a word or the beginning of a new word, PE II
moves that word or character to a new line.  Also, when you
reflow a paragraph or center lines, the margin settings control
the reformatting.

See also ? MARGINS, LEFT MARGIN, RIGHT MARGIN, PARAGRAPH MARGIN,
CENTER IN MARGINS, and REFLOW.


                               69


SET SEARCHCASE~

________________________________________

SET SEARCHCASE controls whether or not
case is respected in LOCATE or CHANGE
command searches.
________________________________________

Format:  set searchcase any
         set searchcase exact

If you specify ANY (the default), then a search for "xYz" finds
the strings "xyz", "XYZ", and "xYz," among others.  If you
specify EXACT, then only the string "xYz" is found.

See also ? SEARCHCASE, CHANGE, and LOCATE.







SET TABEXPAND~

________________________________________

SET TABEXPAND controls whether or not
tabs are converted to runs of blanks by
default in the EDIT command.
________________________________________

Format:  set tabexpand on
         set tabexpand off

The default value of SET TABEXPAND is ON.  Regardless of the
value of SET TABEXPAND, tab expansion can always be controlled
explicitly in the EDIT command using the TABS or NOTABS options.

See also ? TABEXPAND, EDIT, SET BLANKCOMPRESS, and
? BLANKCOMPRESS.





                               70


SET TABS~

________________________________________

SET TABS changes the tab markers from
the current setting.
________________________________________

Format:  set tabs t1 t2 t3 t4 ... t20

You can assign 20 tabs to a file between column 1 and 255.

The numbers must follow in increasing order.  The second number
has to be larger than the first, and the third larger than the
second, and so on.

PE II starts with tab settings every eight spaces, starting at 9,
17, 25, and so on, unless reset in the profile.  To change the
tabs, type the SET TABS command and the tab numbers on the
command line and press Enter.

Example:  set tabs 5 10 15 20

To see the current tab settings, enter ? TABS on the command
line.

When you use the EDIT command to create a new file or display an
old one, the tab settings for that file are the tab settings for
whatever file was on the screen when you typed the EDIT command.

You cannot save the tab settings of a file.  They have to be
reset each time you start PE II.

This command controls the tab settings used by the TAB and
BACKTAB commands, but not the  ab positions used by blank
compression and tab expansion by the EDIT, FILE, and SAVE
commands.  The latter tab positions are fixed at every eight
columns beginning at column 9.

________________________________________

SPLIT divides the current line into two lines.  Text before the
cursor on the current line remains on that line and text at or
past the cursor is moved to a newly inserted line beginning at
column one.

The only way to insert a line before the beginning of the file is
to use SPLIT when the cursor is in the first column of the file.

There are four possible divisions of the screen into windows:

o  The entire screen as one window

o  The screen split vertically into two windows

o  The screen split vertically and horizontally into four windows

o  The screen split horizontally into two windows

SPLIT SCREEN cycles through these four divisions in the above
order.

was there the last time the cursor
moved onto the line.
_______________________________________

UNDO recovers erased lines or words as long as the cursor had not
left the current line before the change was made.  Once the
cursor leaves the line or joins two lines, you cannot restore
that line.

If the cursor has left the line, you can retrieve the last five
changes from the .UNNAMED internal file.  To see the .UNNAMED
file, on the command line enter: e .unnamed

If you do not specify a number, UP moves the cursor up one line.

The column of the cursor does not change.

If the cursor is at the top of the window but not at the top of
the file, the cursor remains stationary and the text in the
window shifts down by one line, bringing a new line into view.

If you use UP on the command line, the cursor moves to the bottom
line of the current window in the text area.

See also DOWN.


                               76

Command Abbreviations~


This section lists the possible abbreviations of all the PE II
commands.  Commands that do not accept parameters can be
abbreviated to two letters enclosed in square brackets.  Some
commands that take parameters can be abbreviated by a single
letter, as described below.

Macros and profiles that use abbreviations execute faster.  The
default profile PE2.PRO that you received with PE II uses
abbreviations and eliminates keys internally defined by PE II.
This abbreviated profile starts PE II many times quicker than a
profile such as PE2LONG.PRO that contains nonabbreviated and
redundant key definitions.

See the section "Commands" for a description of the meanings of
the commands.

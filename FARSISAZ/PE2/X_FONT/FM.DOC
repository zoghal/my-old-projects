         Requirements:
           
           IBM computer or 100% compatible "clone"
           DOS 2.0 or higher
           EGA, VGA, or 100% compatible video system
           At least 80k of free memory


         Overview:

               Are you tired of the letter style of your computer?  Are you
         looking for a change?  Maybe you simply would like to have some fun?
         FONT MANIA might just be the answer.

               FONT MANIA is designed for editing EGA and VGA fonts with ease.
         It incorporates a user-friendly menu-driven sytem which makes using 
         FONT MANIA incredibly easy.  It is also packed with powerful tools for
         easy editing of fonts.  Here are just a few examples of applications
         and uses for FONT MANIA:

               -   Edit your computer's default text font, or create a 
                   completely new font-set.

               -   Save the font in a COM file which you can easily activate 
                   from the DOS prompt or from any BATCH file, including your 
                   AUTOEXEC.BAT

               -   If you are a programmer, you can incorporate your redesigned
                   fonts into your programs.

               -   Use custom fonts to create special effects and more

         DEMO.EXE included with this package demonstrates several incredible
         uses of FONT MANIA.  To run the DEMO, type the following:

                                        DEMO

         and press <ENTER>.  The demo will run and you can print this manual, 
         or the registration form at the end of the DEMO.





 





                                      1


 



         QUICK TOUR:

         Type the following at DOS prompt:

                                          FM

         then press <ENTER>.  FONT MANIA's editing screen should appear on the 
         monitor.  If not, check to make sure you are in the right drive and
         path, and the program file is there, then try again.

         You will see a giant yellow 'A' in a black area on left side of the 
         screen.  This is the editing area.  To the right of the editing area 
         are two boxes, one labeled STATUS, and the other labeled KEY.  The 
         STATUS box shows the current status of FONT MANIA.  The KEY box shows
         the listing of the valid keys or key-combinations you may use.

         Try moving the cursor by pressing right arrow key.  You will observe
         the cursor moving one space to the right.  Try pressing other arrow 
         keys.  The cursor will move according to the arrows.  Try pressing 
         PgDn (Page Down), and you will see a huge 'B'.  Press PgUp (Page Up)
         to return 'A' to the screen.  Now press space bar once.  The pixel un-
         der the cursor will toggle on or off.  Notice the change in the 'A' in
         the status box.  Now press the tab key (that's the key with right and
         left arrows on it).  The entire character set will appear in place of
         the editing area.  Move the cursor in various directions.  Press the
         Enter key to return to the editing area ... it will now contain a
         large image of the character your cursor was on when you pressed the
         Enter key.

         Now, let's try loading a font.  Press F3 and FONT MANIA will prompt 
         you for a filename.  Type the following:

                                       COM_DEMO

         then press <ENTER>.  FONT MANIA will load the font.  If there is an 
         error, make sure you have the file COM_DEMO.COM in your current di-
         rectory.

         After FONT MANIA finishes loading the font, you will notice a change
         in the pattern of the huge 'A'.  Let's try some other tools.  Press 
         and hold the ALT key; then press I.  The whole character will be in-
         verted!  Again, notice the change in the 'A' in the status box.  You 
         are encuraged to try all the commands listed in the KEY box.

         Now Press and hold ALT-A to save the font in COM file format.  You 
         will be prompted for a filename.  Type:

                                        MYFONT

         Press <ENTER>.  The font is saved with the name MYFONT.COM. (The COM 
         extension is automatically added to your filename.)

         Press ESC to exit the program.  Press 'Y' when asked if you really 
         want to exit.  That's it!!!, you just learned how to use FONT 
         MANIA!!!  Pretty painless, wasn't it?!

         USING FONT MANIA:

         To run FONT MANIA from DOS, just type the following:

                                     FM [filename]

         and press <ENTER>.  Where [filename] is the optional file name of a
         font file previously made with FONT MANIA.  If the filename is inclu-
         ded, the font will load.  If you do not specify a font filename
         FONT MANIA will use whichever font is already active, usually your
         computer's default ROM BIOS font.  For more information on loading 
         a font, see LOADING FONTS.

         FONT MANIA's editing screen will appear.  There are many different 
         area of this screen which serve different functions.  It really is not
         confusing - just extremely comprehensive!

         Menu Bar:

               Across the top of the screen locate the menu bar.  This menu 
         bar shows menu titles.  To "pull down" a menu, hold down the ALT key
         while pressing a key corresponding to one of the highlighted char-
         acters in the menu titles.  (Functions when editing area is visible;
         does not function when character set is visible.)

         Status Box:

               The box labeled STATUS provides the current status of FONT
         MANIA.  
               
               LINES shows how many lines of text will fit into the current 
         screen.  The number of lines which may be displayed on the screen  
         at one time varies depending on the number of scanlines and the 
         height of the font.  
               
               VDO shows the current video adapter in use in your system.  

               SCANLINE shows how many horizontal scanlines are currently 
         active.  On EGA systems, this SCANLINE is always 35O.  On VGA, the
         scanline may be set to one of the following values: 2OO, 35O, or 4OO.

               FILENAME shows the current font filename.  If FILENAME shows 
         NONE, that means the font has not yet been given a filename or that
         Font Mania has not been provided with the name of the font during the
         current session.

               At the top of the box may be seen 2 smaller boxes.  The first
         will display the current character being edited, and the second box  
         will show the ASCII decimal value of that character.

               At the bottom of the box you will find 2 numbers separated by a
         colon (:).  This is the current X:Y position of the cursor in the 
         editing area.

         Key Box:

               This is the large box labeled KEY.  This always shows the 
         valid keyboard commands.  It will show the key combination which per-
         form each function.

         Status Line:

               This line is located at the bottom of the screen.  It will 
         report what is currently happening.

         Editing Area:

               This is the middle left hand side of the screen.  When the 
         program is first excuted it will display a huge 'A' in a black 
         rectangle area with blinking cursor (yellow on red.)  This is the
         area in which each character of the font-set will be edited.



         EDITING COMMANDS:

               All editing commands are displayed in the KEY box. Press F1 for
         the "second page."

        This is the list of commands and their functions:


            Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys will move the cursor.
                           Hold either Shift key in combination with one of the
                           arrow keys to "drag" the pixel. (Some computers need
                           the Num Lock key pressed first.  If so, be certain
                           to press Num Lock again when finished.)

            PgUp, PgDn   - Change the editing character to the previous 
                           character or the next one.

            Space        - The Space Bar toggles the pixel at the 
                           current cursor position on or off.

            CTRL-H, V    - Blank the Horizontal line or Vertical line.

            ALT-H, V     - Fill (turn all pixels on) the Horizontal or 
                           Vertical line.
             
            TAB          - Select from the character set.  The large yellow-
                           on-black font disappears to be replaced by the char-
                           acter table.  Use arrow keys to move the cursor to 
                           the character you want; then press <ENTER>.

            CTRL-D       - Copy the default character, i.e.: If you have begun 
                           to edit a character you may cancel your editing with
                           this command.

                           location in the editing area.  When you press ALT-C 
                           the character table will appear.  Use arrow keys to
                           move the red cursor to the SOURCE character (which 
                           you want copied to the TARGET location).  Press <EN-
                           TER> to copy that character to your TARGET location.

            ALT-I        - Invert the character.  All of the pixels are 
                           reversed.  Pixels which are on will turn off, and 
                           the pixels which are off will turn on.

            Insert       - Insert a blank pixel at the current cursor 
                           position.  All pixels to the right are shifted to 
                           the right one column-space.

            Delete       - Delete pixel at the current cursor position.  All 
                           pixels to the right are shifted to the left.

            F2           - Save font.  See SAVING FONTS
    
            F3           - Load font.  See LOADING FONT.

            F5           - Flip vertical.  Directly inverts character, but
                           does not reverse it horizontally.

            F6           - Flip Horizontal.  Creates a "mirror image."

            F7           - Copy row.  All pixels below the cursor are shifted 
                           down one row. 

            F8           - Copy column.  All pixels to the right of the cursor 
                           are shifted to the right once.

            ESC          - Exit FONT MANIA.  The font you edited will be left
                           active.  Type, and text will appear onscreen in
                           its altered (custom) form.  To restore the compu-
                           ter's default font, type the following DOS command:

                                       MODE CO80  (Note: 2nd character is
                                                   letter O, last is zero.)

                           then press <ENTER>. 

         You are encouraged to try all these commands.  After all, it is the
         best way to learn to use FONT MANIA.

         Notice that CTRL commands will usually delete something, and ALT 
         commands usually add something to the editing character.  CTRL-A, S, 
         W, and Z are easy to remember.  Notice where A, S, W, and Z are 
         placed on the keyboard.

   Create a new font style by altering your default font to a taller, thinner 
   font by deleting some pixels and adding others. Do the same to each letter 
   of the alphabet.  Save, and you have a brand new letterstyle! Once you are 
   "in the swing of it" each letter takes less than 1 minute to revise.       


         USING MENUS:

               FONT MANIA has been written as a menu-driven program to make 
         it easier to learn and use.  FONT MANIA has 5 different menus: FILE,
         SCAN LINE, FONT, HEIGHT, and BLOCK.  To activate a menu, make sure
         the editing area is visible rather than the character set.  Press and 
         hold the ALT key, then press a key corresponding to the highlighted 
         letter in a menu title.  Use arrow keys to select the items in the 
         menu or to change to another menu once you have accessed one of them.

                                       6







         FILE menu:

               Contains 8 items: Save, Save As..., Save ASM, Save PAS, Save C,
         Save BIN, Load, About, and Exit.  Selecting from among these items 
         will permit the use of the following functions:

            Save:
               Selecting this item is the same as using F2 command.  Font 
            Mania will save the font in COM format.  See SAVING FONTS for more 
            information.  If 'FILE NAME' shows a name, that name will be used
            and you will NOT be warned that the file already exists.

            Save As...:
               Selecting this item is the same as using ALT-A.  Font Mania 
            will prompt you to enter a filename for the font. See SAVING FONTS 
            for more information.  If you enter the name of an existing file
            you will be warned of that fact.

            Save ASM:
               Save the font in ASSEMBLY text file format.  See SAVING FONTS 
            for more information.

            Save PAS:
               Save the font in PASCAL format.  See SAVING FONTS for more 
            information.

            Save C:
               Save the font in C header file format.  See SAVING FONTS for 
            more information.
     
            Save BIN:
               Save the font in raw BINARY format.  See SAVING FONTS for more 
            information.   

            Load:
               Selecting this item is identical to using F3.  FONT MANIA 
            loads the saved font file (COM format only) and reinitializes 
            itself.  See LOADING FONT for more information.

            About...:
               Displays information about FONT MANIA.

            Exit:
               Selecting this item is the same as pressing ESC.  FONT MANIA
            will ask if you really want to exit the program.  If the font
            has been modified after the last saving of the font in COM file 
            format, FONT MANIA then ask if you want to save the font.


         SCAN LINE menu:

               Contains 3 items: 200, 350, and 400.  Each of the numbers cor-
         responds to the number of scan lines on your monitor screen.  This 
         scan line changing feature is operable only on VGA systems.  If you 
         have EGA and try to change the scan line, FONT MANIA will display an 
         ERROR message.  EGA always has 35O scan lines.

                                       7







         FONT menu:

               Contains 3 items: 8, 14, and 16 points.  Each of the items cor-
         responds to your computer's ROM BIOS font.  EGA systems have only 8 or
         14 point fonts.  16 point font is available on VGA systems. Once you
         select a font, FONT MANIA loads the corresponding font into the edit-
         ting buffer and resets itself.  

               WARNING:    When a font is selected from the FONT menu, if
                           you have been editing another font your changes 
                           will be lost unless you first save your revised
                           font for future use.
         HEIGHT menu:

               Contains 16 numbers which correspond to the height to which
         a font may be changed.  The font being edited is NOT lost when this
         option is used.  If the height selected from this menu is greater than
         the height of the current font, the current font will "STRETCH" to the
         height selected.  If the height selected is shorter than the current
         height, one or more lines at the bottom of the block will be lost.  If
         this occurs there is no command which will restore the missing part. 
         If characters are moved up (block 'Move up') leaving blank lines at 
         the bottom of the font block, a lesser height may be selected without
         causing deletion of the lowermost pixels of the characters.

               WARNING:    Selection of a short height may cause characters to 
                           be so truncated that the program's menu will be il-
                           legible!  Should this occur, you must immediately 
                           press <ESC> followed by 'Y' and then type MODE CO80
                           and <ENTER>.  If done with care rebooting is not 
                           needed.  It is a good idea to write this on a "Post-
                           it" note and stick it on your wall!

               IMPORTANT:  SCANLINE and FONT HEIGHT must "match" in order to
                           make a perfect 25-line display when the font is
                           used.  The following chart indicates the corre-
                           sponding values for SCANLINE and FONT HEIGHT:

                                       SCANLINE        FONT HEIGHT
               
                                           200                8  
                                           350               14
                                           400               16

               By using different combinations of HEIGHT, FONT and SCAN LINES,
         you can create a screen which can display, almost anywhere, between 12
         and 400 lines on a VGA system!!!

         BLOCK menu:
    
               This menu contains some of the editing commands which are 
         likely to be used for all characters or for a block of characters 
         simultaneously.  Each of the functions listed in the BLOCK menu 
         perform the same function as the editing commands, but on the 
         set (block) of characters rather than only one character.


                                       8




               One unique function in this BLOCK menu is the BLOCK LOAD*
         function.  This option is similar to LOAD in the FILE menu, but in-
         stead of replacing the current font by loading another entire font
         file, BLOCK loads only the character(s) in the current block.  Thus
         it is easy to combine different portions (one or more characters) of
         more than one font COM file.  The uses of this feature are many.  Just
         as an example, if for some reason you wanted lowercase text to appear
         in one style and uppercase in another style, you could "block copy"
         lowercase from one font COM to another.  To set your block, press the
         Tab key to bring the entire character set to the screen.  Place the
         cursor on the first character of the desired block and press B (for
         "Begin").  Then move the cursor to the last character of the block and
         press E ("End").  Now Tab again and select BLOCK LOAD.  Type the name 
         of the font COM from which you want to load the characters of the 
         block. In an instant the job will be done!  

                Similarly, you may combine 2 sets of uppercase characters, one
         style to appear when caps lock is "on" and the other when it is "off."
         First copy "A" to the "a" location within one COM file; continue 
         through the alphabet and save the file as TEMP.COM. Load a COM file of
         a different font style and mark the lowercase characters as a block.
         Then BLOCK LOAD that block from TEMP.COM and you will have a new font
         COM file with two sets of uppercase characters.  Another use for the
         block load/block copy option is to move special characters from one
         font COM file to another, as when you have a file containing a nicely
         shaped star or skull or special logo, and you want to copy it into a
         different font COM file.  How would you like to have a text appear on
         the screen with your signature in script at the bottom?  Load a script
         font COM (you'll get one with the registered version) and copy the
         letters of your name to characters not used in your text.  If you are
         Tom Pane, copy T to !, o to @, m to # and so forth.  Save the file as
         TEMP.COM and then block load !@#$%^& to the COM you'll use for your 
         text.  When you type !@# $%^& Tom Pane will appear in "handwriting!"

         SAVING FONTS:

               FONT MANIA offers many saving formats: COM, ASSEMBLY, PASCAL, 
         C, and BINARY.  The standard format is COM file.  This is also the 
         only format which FONT MANIA can load.

            COM:
               Saving in COM format is very simple.  You can press ALT-S, ALT- 
            A, or F2 while the editing screen is visible.  If you use ALT-S or 
            F2, and the font file already has a name, FONT MANIA will save the 
            file using that name and overwrite the old file.  If the font has
            not yet been named, or if you use ALT-A, FONT MANIA will ask if you
            want to save it in 4O column mode.  If you press 'Y', the resultant
            COM file will change the screen mode to 4O columns when executed,
            rather than 8O columns.  Then FONT MANIA will prompt you for a file
            name.  Enter a name, including path if desired, with no extension. 
            If there is an existing file of the same name you will be alerted 
            to avoid overwriting it.  The extension COM will be added automat-
            ically.  After saving you will be returned to the editing screen.



 
*The block load and block copy options are available in the registered version 
 of Font Mania.

            ASSEMBLY:
               To save in ASSEMBLY format, you must select Save ASM from the 
            FILE menu.  You will be asked for the filename.  Again, no 
            extension is needed.  The extension ASM will be automatically 
            added to the end of the file name.  After the name is entered you
            will be prompted for a reference to be used.  This is the name 
            used as the label for the font data.  You will be returned to the 
            editing screen after FONT MANIA has completed these two saves.

            PASCAL:
               To save in PASCAL format, select Save PAS from the FILE menu. 
            You will be asked for the filename.  Again, no extension is needed.
            The extension PAS will be automatically added. When prompted for a 
            reference, enter a name to be used as the label for the font data.
            You will be returned to the editing screen after the save.

            C:
               To save in C Header format, select Save C from the FILE menu.  
            You will be asked for the filename.  Again, no extension is 
            needed.  Extension H will be automatically added to the end of the 
            file name.  After the file name is entered, you will be prompted 
            for a reference.  This is the name to be used as the label for the 
            responding values for SCANLINE and FONT HEIGHT:

                                       SCANLINE        FONT HEIGHT
               
                                           200                8  
                                           350               14
                                           400               16

            BINARY:
               To save in raw BINARY format, select Save BIN.  No extension is 
            needed; extension BIN is automatically added to the end of the 
            file name.  After entering the file name, you will be asked for 
            a reference.  This is the name to be used as the label for the 
            font data.  You will be returned to the editing screen after 
            FONT MANIA saves the files. This format is for use with 
            languages other than the languages above.


         LOADING A FONT:

              There are 3 ways to load a font for editing.  Because FONT 
         MANIA will use whichever font is active at the time the program is 
         loaded, you may first load a font (COM file) and then run FONT 
         MANIA.  This method is somewhat unreliable, especially if the cur-
         rent screen mode is 4O columns.  It is preferable to use the com-
         mand line method to effect loading of the font and FONT MANIA 
         together.  To load a font using the command line method, type the 
         following at the DOS prompt and then press <ENTER>.

                                  FM [filename]


                                      10









         In the above command "filename" is the name of a FONT MANIA COM 
         file.  The file will be loaded automatically.  To load a different
         font while FONT MANIA is in operation, use ALT-L or choose "Load" 
         from the filemenu which is accessed with ALT-F.  You will be prompted
         for a filename.  After  entering the filename FONT MANIA will load 
         the font and reinitialize itself.


         USING COM FONT FILES:

               COM files are easiest to use.  Just type the name of the COM 
         file at the DOS prompt; font will be loaded and the SCAN LINE will be
         set (on VGA systems).  For example, to load the font file named 
         COM_DEMO.COM type the following command and press <ENTER>:

                                       COM_DEMO

         As the file is loaded the scan line will be set to the correct scan 
         line setting (VGA systems only).  The font will be active as long as
         there is no change in video mode and no other font is loaded.  

         INSTALLING A MEMORY RESIDENT FONT:  

               If it is desired to have a particular font remain active during
         the running of various programs, it may be loaded as a memory-resident
         program with the use of the R or I options. For example, type this at
         the DOS prompt followed by <ENTER>:

                                      COM_DEMO I

         The font will be loaded and remain resident in memory until the compu-
         ter is reset or turned off.  Such a memory-resident font will reload 
         whenever a change occurs in video mode, but graphics will not be af-
         fected.  To see how much memory is used by a font file, run ZMEM.EXE 
         (Comes with the REGISTERED VERSION of FONT MANIA).

         The command line options which are available are:
    
                           <filename> [B#] [H|?] [I|R|U]

              <filename>     - name of the COM file
              B#             - specify character generator block to use
                               (should be set to 0)
              H              - display help
              ?              - same as above
              I              - install font in memory
              R              - permanently install font in memory
              U              - uninstall font from memory.

         One a font is installed in memory, the following three keyboard com- 
         mands will be available:




                                      11









              CTRL+ALT+E     - enables automatic font loading
              CTRL+ALT+D     - disables automatic font loading
              CTRL+ALT+F     - user-requested unconditional font loading

         For example, suppose you want to load the font into the character 
         generator block 0 and install the font in the memory.  You would 
         use the command:

                                      AMB b0 i

         then press enter.  Notice the use of the 'I' option.  This option 
         enables you to uninstall the font from memory at any time with
         the 'U' option.   For example, to uninstall AMB.COM type the fol-
         lowing:
         
                                       AMB u

         If you ever encounter software compatibility problems when using
         the I option, try the R option instead.  But be aware of the fact
         that when the R option is employed the font COM may not be removed
         from memory without restarting or resetting the computer.  It may, 
         however, be temporarily disabled with keyboard commands mentioned 
         above.


         USING OTHER FONT FILE FORMATS:

            In general a program must use the ROM BIOS interrupt 10H (16), the
         screen control interrupt, function 11H sub-function 10H to load the 
         font.  The following are the parameters needed to call the interrupt:

                       AH = 11H
                       AL = 10H
                       BH = points (bytes per character)
                       BL = block (use 0)
                       CX = number of character defined by table (256)
                       DX = first character code in table (use 0)
                       ES = segment of the table
                       BP = offset of the table

         For ASSEMBLY, C, and PASCAL, see the following files for examples of 
         the above.  These may be typed to the screen or printed:

                                     PAS_DEMO.PAS
                                     ASM_DEMO.ASM
                                     C_DEMO.C 

         For other languages, a programmer might use the COM file format by 
         shelling out to DOS to load the COM file.  For example, in Quick Basic
         the following command may be utilized:





                                      12










                                 SHELL "AMB.COM"

         Alternately, the BINARY format may be used by loading the content of 
         the file into a memory buffer, putting the memory address of that 
         buffer into ES:BP, filling in the parameters, and then calling inter-
         rupt 1OH.  Do not use the R command line when shelling out to run a
         font COM file.  This action will generate a "fatal error" which will
         halt the system.




         CREATING SPECIAL EFFECTS

              The spceial effects used in the DEMO program are quite easy to 
         make with FONT MANIA.  Some effects are done by combining two or
         more characters.  Here are several examples showing how you may
         create special effects with FONT MANIA:

            INITIALS:

               In this effect, once the COM file is loaded, typing one key will
            produce a word, name or initials in miniature letters.  It is 
            quite easy to alter a character (or more than one, if you like) to
            achieve this effect.  Pick any character you want to convert to its
            new use.  You might select characters such as < and > for example, 
            and totally change each of them:

            Whenever the font containing these 2 designs is active, typing
            "<" will create a small "UT" initial, and typing ">" will create
            "LOU".  These are just sample letters and designs.  You may use
            any letter, numeral or design you wish.

               In the preceding example the equals sign (=) has been rede-
            signed to be the flame, the bracket (]) becomes the tail piece, 
            the minus sign (-) is the body of the missile, and the greater-
            than symbol (>) the  head of the missile.  When the font contain-
            ing this design is active, typing (or having a program "print") 
            this string: "=]--->" will create a missile pointing to the right.
            Notice the use of more than one minus sign in the string.  By in-
            cluding more than 1 body character the missile becomes as long as 
            desired.

               To create left-to-right movement, your program must print the 
            missile with a leading space: " =]--->".  First print the string at
            the far left edge of the screen, beginning in column 1.  Then re-
            print the same string 1 character to the right of the first string
            so it overlaps the original.  The leading space will automatically
            erase the unwanted part of the first missile-image on the screen.

            AN ANIMATED CHARACTER:

            Because each character differs just slightly from the first one,
            simply create the first one "pixel by pixel" in Font Mania.  Then
            use the ALT-C "copy" command to create 4 copies; modify the copies
            as shown here.  By displaying these five characters in sequence at
            one location on the screen, the illusion of an hourglass with fall-
            ing sand is created.  With a time-delay after each character's dis-
            play, plus a loop, the animation of a character which is no larger
            than one uppercase letter is easily created!

               These few examples of special effects which may be made with 
            FONT MANIA provide a mere hint of possibilities.  There is no 
            limit to effects which may be created with altered fonts made by 
            FONT MANIA.


         LETTERS "RUNNING TOGETHER": 

            Characters which are the full width of the block will be correct
         when used with a VGA monitor, but the letters will "run together" on
         an EGA monitor.  The enclosed samples, JULIE.COM and POOTER.COM are in
         this category.  Wide fonts may be made narrower for use on EGA systems
         by reducing their width, as we did by narrowing the POOTER font and 
         saving it as POOTER2.COM. To make the letters and numerals narrower,
         we used Font Mania to remove one vertical column from each character 
         with CTRL-X.  In some cases we added a pixel or two to improve a let-
         ter's appearance.  If we made an error, we restored the original font
         with CTRL-D and tried again.  The conversion of POOTER to POOTER2 was
         accomplished in less than 1O  minutes.  Try not to lose sight of the
         possibility of your fonts being used on an EGA system.

         AUTOMATIC MODE RESET:

            In saving a font, selecting "automatic mode reset" will cause the
         scanline of a VGA system to reset to an EGA scanline if you you have
         chosen a scanline of 350 (font height should also be set at 14).  The
         included file CHUNKY.COM is in this category.  There are often advan-
         tages to using the EGA scanline.  For example, this row of extended
         characters appears as a solid bar of dots when the EGA scanline is 
         used:

                  ∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞∞

         The same row will appear as 50 dotted rectangles if the VGA scanline
         is in effect.  NOTE: An EGA system can not be reset to a VGA scanline.

         A font which is not saved with automatic mode reset may produce a
         small problem when it is installed on a system other than the one on
         which it was created.  For example, a font created on a VGA system
         will be slightly "taller" if used with EGA, and the listing of a long
         file directory will result in the apparent "disappearance" of the DOS
         prompt and cursor below the bottom line of the screen.  If this occurs
         do not panic.  Simply clear the screen with the CLS command and your
         DOS prompt and cursor will reappear in the top left corner.  The re-
         verse effect will occur if a font made on an EGA system is displayed 
         on a VGA monitor.  25 lines of text will not extend to the bottom of 
         the screen, because each line will be vertically "stunted."  To pre-
         vent these minor annoyances when you anticipate that your font may be 
         used on both systems, save it as a 14-point font with a scanline of 
         350 and select automatic mode reset.  If this is done, the font height
         will not vary  regardless of whether it is used with VGA or EGA.
	 
         There are times when it is advantageous not to use the automatic mode
         reset.  For example, if you want the text on the screen to "magically"
         change to a different font, you must have the 2nd font saved without
         automatic mode reset.  Otherwise the screen will blank during the mode
         set and the change will not appear as magical.


         CREATING TALL, SMALL, AND WIDE FONTS:

         Use ALT-N and ALT-O to select various combinations of scanline and 
         point size before saving a font.  Then exit the program and check the
         results.  Also try saving a font in 40 column mode rather than the
         usual 80 column mode.  When this is done, you must reload the font
         after exiting Font Mania.  Experimentation will teach you more than
         we can provide here, and you will enjoy discovering the combinations
         which will provide the tallest and widest fonts as well as the tiniest
         ones.

         RESTORING THE DEFAULT FONT:

               The default font style is that which appears on your screen when
         you start your computer.  Your computer has one particular font or 
         lettering style stored in its read-only memory or ROM.  When a COM 
         file created in Font Mania is put into use, at a later time you may
         wish to return to the default font.  This will happen automatically
         each time your computer is started or reset, unless your AUTOEXEC.BAT
         file is set up to load a font COM.  However, it is not necessary to 
         reset the computer to return the default font to the screen.  If 
         neither the I nor R option has been used in loading the font COM file,
         typing the following DOS command will restore the default font after 
         the Enter key is pressed:  mode CO80

         If the font COM file has been installed with the I option, it must be
         uninstalled with the U option.  This will restore the default font. 
         If the font COM is one which resets the video mode, restoring the 
         default font will not restore the computer's default video mode (EGA 
         or VGA scanline) if it has been changed.  To restore the video mode or
         scanline run EGA.COM or VGA.COM (included with registered Font Mania).
         VGA.COM has no effect if you are using a system with an EGA monitor.
         If you write a batch file or program which resets the video mode, and
         you anticipate its use on both EGA and VGA systems, you may end the 
         file with commands which run EGA.COM followed by VGA.COM.  In this way
         you may be assured the system will be reset to both the default font 
         and the default video mode or scanline.
